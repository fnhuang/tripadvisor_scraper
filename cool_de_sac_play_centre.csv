1,Unhappy with safety standards,"Went with my 16 month old active toddler who's at a stage in life where she grabs everything and wants to taste it. That being said, the card machine didnt work at the reception, ok weird that my card was ""declined"", to top it off the cafeteria only accepts cash? Super weird. The safety part - the major part of the play area had a million minute pieces of Legos all over the place. There was no segregation for toddlers (0-3yrs old) from the rest of the other kids. And the so called toddler area is way back that its impossible to get the child there without the fear of these legos! Teriible experience and fear of my child swallowing a toy was horrible. Polliwogs is way better",en,2019-10-17,Kalyanirr,"Singapore, Singapore",66,14
1,Not worth for 3y.o. and above.,"I visited Cool De Sac on 23 Jul 2019 with my 3,5 y.o. son.  And I felt very disappointed.  Art corner supposed to have craft activities, but nothing there. There are only colouring with crayons. Is your child here to do just colouring if you paid $23 for the weekday ticket? Of course, not.  We found just a few small LEGO blocks. Personal refused us to take displayed lego blacks. I asked where is LEGO? The answer was : on sanitation.  There is a Tree house here. But it can be fun for kids below 3.   There are only 2 activities for 3y.o.+: slide and big blue blocks. That’s it! My child doesn’t play computer games, otherwise he can play here.   Cool de Sac NOT COOL anymore. All old good reviews are not valid. Things changed.",en,2019-07-25,CruiserFaith,,2,1
1,Good Fun for the Kids,"This was our 2nd visit in 2 years the kids specially requested to come back here as they loved the open concept play area. They have arts and crafts, Legos, Costumes and off course the play areas which are spread around so the kids loved running around unleashed. We didn't try the food the entry fee is reasonable unlimited playtime on weekdays really good place to let kids be kids.",en,2019-04-24,alhasan1909,"Lahore, Pakistan",812,76
1,Fun place for kids,"We planned a play date for the kiddos with our friwnds and their kid. The kids had a lot of fun on the slides, the lego area, the ball pit and so on. We also had lunch at the cafe. Perfect food for kiddos, cheesy and tasty. However they have limited veg options. It isnt the best or biggest indoor playground in Singapore but is pretty good and is relatively inexpensive.",en,2019-04-11,GlobalLocalTraveller,"Singapore, Singapore",177,29
1,Not bad! And not great either..,"Went with my 7 mths old baby. Already expected not much since my baby not able to do much there.  The place could be more cleaner as I dont feel its really clean at the ball pit area.  But to be fair, customer service was good and the staffs were friendly.",en,2018-10-16,aidivedder,"Singapore, Singapore",53,16
2,Went with a toddler and disappointed,"Went with my 9 month old and was disappointed with the toddler area. Hardly any toys and the toys that were there were badly worn out. One of the toys on the wall with pictures of people on completely worn out. A stand up activity table with no batteries and completely worn pictures. A few large Legos, a plastic bridge, a small climbing frame with small slides (just the right size for little ones), a couple of wall puzzles and foam mats on the floor.  They had ball pits and it was clean but i wouldn't go again due to the disappointing toddler area.",en,2018-09-03,rahh,uk,222,106
2,Clean and Fun for the kids,"Really fun place for the kids so much to do play with Legos, do Art and Crafts they have face painting and costumes for the kids to dress up in decent size play area. The place is clean and well maintained and the staff are helpful too. The only thing is the food is not very good at all and is expensive. The kids really enjoyed it.",en,2018-05-23,alhasan1909,"Lahore, Pakistan",812,76
2,Good for kids,"I like it because it was clean and there were attentive staffs eventho it was on a Monday. And not much children roaming around which I enjoyed as I could watch my kids from the bench. My 4yo and 1yo spent 3hours there. The only thing which I did not enjoy was the food. Don't bother ordering the pizza and it tasted frozen. My kids who love pizza did not enjoy it. I ordered a pot of beef brisket soup and it tasted like those instant powder with pathetic beef slices and few slices of fried omelette and nothing else. The soup costed $20++ which is rather expensive. There are a lot of restaurant outside the playground, so I would suggest going elsewhere for lunch.",en,2018-03-21,Miss_J0804,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",35,10
2,Nice place,"Nothing wow experience but our son did enjoy. They have resto but not that appealing and bit expensive, lego was the main attraction for my son but others is fine.",en,2017-05-10,Ibrahim1024,"Singapore, Singapore",236,11
2,Good but needs a toilet,"Nice place, my 3yo had fun. Not really worth the price but Singapore is expensive everywhere.   My biggest gripe is no toilets nearby, had to run across the mall to the nearest, which is ridiculous when you are a playground for children.",en,2017-05-05,Mitzzay,"Canberra, Australia",18,14
3,good place to spend an afternoon with kids,Clean play area inside a shopping mall. Not much rides but good to spend 2-3 hours with kids. they have a restaurant as well but I did not eat there.,en,2017-04-11,safoura-ari,"Stockholm, Sweden",212,42
3,don't forget your socks!!,"here you can let yr. kids play indoor without suncream and air-conditioned you will meet kids mostly of age 1 to 6  there are different areas like building, slides, drawing and painting or just playing with lego blocks or dressed like fairies there is also a bistro linked cost only 12sn$ for a 2 and 1/2 kid  walking distance from city hall mrt",en,2016-10-08,followmike,"Singapore, Singapore",64,86
3,Drop and go! Kids won't even miss you!,"Our kids loved the indoor play area. There's so much to do. What makes it different from other play centres is the on-going all day face painting, dress-up, Lego, and even Wii Stations.  It's like being in a birthday party all day!   Their pricing is also very attractive. they have an all-day play price!! super super worth your moolah.",en,2016-07-13,Mumseword,Spore,98,40
3,Indoor playground,"We wanted to go to a park but was raining, so we decided to pay Cool de Sac a visit. The custimer service was great. Not many equipments for kids to climb up n down but they hv a variety of different activities from.cosplay to lego to slides n digital mat.  My kids had a good time. But it was slightly expensive though.",en,2016-06-15,691gladysl,"Singapore, Singapore",298,35
3,Nice indoor playarea for younger kids!,"A friend of us told about cool the sac. We visited and then we visited it for so many more times. Located in Suntec Convention center, it is a place where your kid can play and you can spend from 3 to 5 hours. There is an entry fee and two adults are allowed to enter along with a kid. You will need to wear socks too. Better to carry socks, else you will have to buy it.   Once you enter, the play section is beautiful. There are huge animal posters on the wall, a bridge kind of where kids can climb from one end, crawl/ walk over the bridge to the other end. There is a section where you can draw and colour with kids. I like this section as we can do team work with kid and tap on some creativity. There is a Lego section where kids do get engrossed. The slides at the entrance are nice way to play with kids and parents too can do it! Then there are toys section and small ball pool. Overall it is a colourful place offering varied interest areas.  There is a small cafe too which serves some basic coffee, tea and few munchings. But this can be improved many folds. There is small party area too.  Good for kids from 8 months to 2 years. Weekdays are less crowded. Sometimes it may be closed for public if somebody has done booking for private party, always better to call/ mail before going.",en,2016-05-07,Karan_06A,"Singapore, Singapore",613,44
4,Decent place,"The Play area is decent, esp for younger kids but the bistro food is not upto the mark. scope for improvement",en,2016-02-06,GazalP,"Singapore, Singapore",982,169
4,Don't get what you pay for,"Small. Few activities. Still have to pay over 20$ per 4yo child.   Legos are propably only things interesting here for a girl this age. Climbing area very small to a 4yo but too big for 1yo. Legos very small, so not for small children. Coffee is terrible and expensive. Not coming here again.",en,2016-01-19,miukoistinen,"Singapore, Singapore",35,18
4,Underwhelming play area,"I came here on a rainy day with my 3&5 yos. At 27 sgd/ kid I had pretty high expectations which were not met. While the tree house was quite cool my children ran through the rest of it pretty quickly. The art table didn't have anything you don't have at home, basically paper coloured pencils and crayons. The block station is a table with some Lego in the middle. I think my biggest complaint was with the lack of cleanliness. Despite signs forbidding outside food there seemed to be ground in food detritus everywhere. At half the price and after a good clean this place might be worth it but not as it stands now.",en,2015-08-03,Repasa2,,13,11
4,Nice place to hang out ... for children,"This is my first trip to Cool de Sac, and my second trip to a play centre for children (my first was to Kidz Amaze at SAFRA Toa Payoh). First of all, I must qualify the following: I was at both play centres for birthday celebrations, hence there was free flow of food and drinks; the children had a structured programme as part of the birthday celebrations; the entrance fee didn't bother me, since I don't have to pay for it.  My review will focus on three big areas: play equipment, space layout, and service. I will be making comparisons with Kidz Amaze since that was my first experience in a play centre, my purpose at Kidz Amaze was the same (birthday celebrations), and the experience there was my only way of comparison.  Play equipment - definitely a wider range of toys and play equipment compared to Kidz Amaze. There are more toys for kids of different ages to engage with. The play equipment ranges from LEGO blocks, toy cars and dolls, dress up kits (with dressing table and mirrors), electronic games and slides/climbing structures. The equipment allows for different forms of expressions amongst children, whether individual or group-based. The one difference is that Kidz Amaze has more play equipment that arouses the curiosity of children, not just for the purpose of play only.  Space layout - Cool de Sac is spacious, more so than Kidz Amaze. The space is also partitioned for different age groups e.g. toddlers, teens, juniors etc. So you won't get the probability of the bigger kids pushing and getting rough with the younger ones. Kidz Amaze is just one gigantic play structure with different play sections - so the chances of older kids mixing around with the younger ones (and accidents) are higher.  Service - Cool de Sac and Kidz Amaze have its staff walking around to 'police' the premises. While I see Cool de Sac staff staff walking round to ensure order, I think the value-add for Kidz Amaze staff is that they go round spotting kids who exhibited good behaviour. What happens is they will award Kidz Amaze Ambassador status to those who exhibited good conduct and behaviour. That is a good way to encourage kids to be their best.  All in, Cool de Sac is a cool place to hang out while the children have some time to play. I would suggest going in if you are tired, your kids need to expend energy, and if you have money to spare (the entrance fee is a little steep, compared to Kidz Amaze). There is another newly opened play centre in Suntec City, in the East Wing you can consider, though I think the entrance fees are roughly around the same.",en,2014-12-23,waimengy2017,"Singapore, Singapore",272,45
4,Great indoor playground for kids,"Great place for kid as it is clean and spacious but limited slides. Even so kids spend hours in the playground as they have costume stage, face painting, play station and an area for younger kids. Café is always pack hence prepare to go early to get a table.",en,2014-10-23,veratan1979,"Singapore, Singapore",6,0
5,Spacious indoor playground with a bistro,"I love the space (most indoor playgrounds have space constraints) & the bistro concept. Staffs are friendly. Entrance fees are reasonable - 1 accompanying adult for every paying child. There are ample space to park strollers, lockers rental at $2, ceiling high shoe cabinets & a baby changing room too. No toilet though! Socks is a must.   Free hand sanitizers are provided at the entrance but what's the use of hand sanitizers when they don't screen for sick kids?? And I believe they do not sanitize/clean the toys well at the end of the day because my 3 year old was down with cough & cold (twice!) on the next day after playing at this playground!",en,2014-10-09,meyxtine,Singapore,312,95
5,Great play area with variety,"Went on the eve of National Day, was very packed even on a weekday afternoon, this place is still quite new so the equipment and items are still in very good condition. The children's areas span the entire open space and parents can park themselves in the cafe right in the middle of it all to monitor their kiddos. Of cos you need to order off the menu but I think it's quite good menu choice and value for $.   The choice of play areas and dress up stations meant kids won't get bored at all.  One gripe : I saw a few kids touching the ceiling lamp at the wooden bridge play set, this meant the design n safety wasn't very well thought out.   Good that there was a clean baby room within premises but no restrooms.  It can be a hassle to walk in and out of the place.",en,2014-08-19,StepheyTSC,"Singapore, Singapore",455,62
5,Amazing in door play ground,"I was looking for a way for my one year old to exert some energy indoors since Singapore was hot when we visited.   This place was amazing! It was $10 for unlimited play for him! There were plenty of things for him to do. From the tree house, slides, climbing structures, tire swing, diy stations for coloring, Legos, dance and dress up... You can easily spend the whole day here.  For those that are hungry, you can eat there while the kids play or go out and come back. They have lockers to rent, so you can lock your purse and just let the kids go have fun!",en,2014-07-25,anniegurumi,"Hong Kong, China",27,14
5,Cool Place to Hang Out,"Our 1st visit to this establishment with much interest from the kids.  Weekdays  Children under 6 months FREE Children under 3 years old $10 Children from 3-12 years old $20  Weekends and Public Holidays  Children under 6 months FREE Children under 3 years old $13 Children from 3-12 years old $26  Our visit started 11.30am with a slight que at the cashier. The place were filled with younger children mainly because the establishment chargers a minimal rate for below 3yrs old. Many ex-pat parents doing their weekly get-together use this opportunity to hang out and catch-up.   The facilities available for the kids: 1. Mini playground and slide 2. Lego Build Me centre 3. Dress-up centre 4. Face painting  5. Mini Stage for mini performances 7. Gaming stations with Wii and Playstation 8. Coloring/drawing centre  Sounds a lot but it's very contained in the area with sufficient to go around.  Ample sitting area to wait, locker and footwear storage area  Bistro Cool serves a good selection but would not go crazy ordering - kids pasta came really too sour but the staff were kind to ask if we would like it changed (generally, the taste wouldn't be much different) but we decline and just chomped down. Kids Pizza was nothing spectacular - please note the pepperoni in the pizza is quite spicy.  The bistro is really short of chairs and sitting, so there would be a good wait the get sitting sorted. Ordering, pay at the cashier when ordering.  If you are thinking of giving the kids a time out from technology, this is NOT the place to be. There are better options for indoor playgrounds that give kids a good workout.  Overall a good experience, friendly and accommodating crew.",en,2014-06-19,carolchalker,"Singapore, Singapore",101,24
5,Cool Place for the Kids from 0 to 12 years...,"its fresh & Cool, as the name!.. it was refreshing to visit this place in the newly opened suntec mall. This is Indoor amusement area for the Kids. Membership varies for weekends and weekdays and as expected, weekends was bit more and time is limited.   Few of the unique items : 1. Refreshing look when you enter and its very very colorful. (See thephotos) 2. Hanging Fox adventure for the kids.  3. Hanging Bridge across two wood areas 4. Longest slide for the kids, ever seen in Indoor park.  5. Personal Makeup for boys (like spider man) and girls (like hello kitty) 6. Tattoo's for the kids  7. Lego Blocks for the kids 8. Two adults are allowed with the kids entry. This is also very good idea..   The entire area is split into baby, toddler and tween section.  Also, this Indoor park is attached with the Bistro Cool restaurant. You can leave the kid to play on his own and you can have quick bite in this restaurant which is also incide the play area itself.   Surpringly, we could find veg options ( :) ).  Truffle Fries (with the tinge of sea weed leaf), Italian Panini, Margherita Pizza..   Overall the experience for very refreshing for both parents & Kid. Even for the kid, enjoyed the longest slide atleast 50 times!!!!  Recommended for 3 hours delightful expericence  Note: Special area available for buggy parking. ....Also, we need to take the socks for kids and parents also",en,2014-04-26,Guru_subbs,"Sydney, Australia",256,31
