At 8 or sometime later, there was an amazing light show covering the entire panoramic landscape in front of the merlion. That made the entire trip worthwhile. Not sure if this is a daily affair, so you may want to check before planning.",en,2020-02-22,RahulMK,"Bengaluru, India",86,50

2,Iconic tourist spot in Singapore,"This is one of the must-see places in Singapore and definitely some camera moments here. However, there were too many tourists in a small spot wanting to take pictures and it got a bit annoying. You can do the River Cruise here for 25 Dollars for 50 minutes - best to choose the one around 8pm so you don't miss the laser show at night.

2,Just a statue,"Keep in mind that this attraction is listed as a park, the Merlion statue is just a statue within the 2,500 square meter park. The park is decent, however the area is not a destination, but more of if you’re already in the area then you may as well visit. The Merlion statue is white in color, spews water through its mouth, weighs 70 tons, and is 28 feet high. The Merlion Park really just provides a photo opportunity of either the Merlion statue or MBS in the background.",en,2020-02-09,digitalroc,"Calgary, Canada",1198,388
2,Ultra-touristy spot,"One of the great tourist spots, instantly associated with Singapore.

4,Great photo op,"If you are in Singapore for more than 3 days, you will most likely end up here. Great place for photos and place to eat. But realistically if you do not eat you are spending maximum 30 minutes here.

5,Photo Spot,"The Merlion is the symbolic sculpture of Singapore, and it is centrally located in the City.   It is around a 10 minute walk from the Esplanade, across Esplanade bridge, and it offers great views of Marina Bay.   The sculpture is also a water feature and it's a great place to get some good photos. It is also free to visit.   I'd recommend spending no more than 20 minutes here, as it can get quite busy and it is mainly a photo spot.   Overall, it is a nice symbolic feature of Singapore and I would recommend a brief visit.",en,2020-01-28,MR_Travels1920,"Woking, United Kingdom",154,26
5,You Haven’t Been To Singapore If...,"There are a couple things that people will tell you must be seen/done if you visit Singapore, and that you haven’t really been there if you miss it. Merlion Park is one of those things.  The statue itself is quite beautiful and impressive, and locals will tell you that it brings good fortune to Singapore (at least that’s what they told us!). You will need to be patient and well-positioned if you want to get good pictures, so take your time, and enjoy the people watching! You will see countless people lining up shots to catch the Merlion’s water in their mouth, hands, coffee cup...the pinnacle of tourist photos akin to holding up the leaning tower of Pisa.  There are a lot of nice views of the skyline in the area, and plenty of places to grab a quick bite or coffee nearby. As with essentially anywhere you go in Singapore, Merlion Park is very well maintained, safe and extremely clean.",en,2020-01-26,gconti82,"Farmington Hills, Michigan",75,2

6,A gem in the crown of Singapore,"The Merlion, and surrounding Merlion Park, are truly gems in the crown of Singapore. There are two Merlion's, one is 8m tall and is a water fountain [visible from across the bay] and another one just tucked away behind it. Of course you're going to take a million and one photos for FB/Twitter/Insta/SnapChat... I'd really recommend getting there early when the crowd is less dense, so you can get better snaps!  Logistically, how to get to the Merlion: Hop on to the Singapore Metro, go to Raffles Place Station. Exit the station from exit C. When you leave, do not go towards the exit opposite you. As you leave, turn left and follow the road around the corner to the HSBC office/branch. Cross the main road and go down the steps to Merlion Park",en,2020-01-16,SierraAlphaFoxtrot,"Leicester, United Kingdom",114,151

7,too crowded,"Merlion Park may be iconic and a must place to visit in Singapore, but it is also full of tourists many of whom are very badly behaved. The Indian couple which pushed aside my daughter from the barrier in front of the Merlion to be able to take a better picture I really wanted to slap but my daughter asked me not to do it. Very mature for a 11 year old. Otherwise the place is very nice, especially at sunset and against the backdrop of Marina Bay Sands and the Fullerton Hotel.",en,2020-01-14,schmidtmg,Switzerland,872,368
7,"Beautiful in the Morning, Wonderful in the evening. ","We went here very early in the morning to stroll, watch and take photos of the sunrise rising behind MBS and shining towards the soon to be removed Merlion Statue. People here are either taking photos, strolling and jogging. The place affords a great view of Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands, Art Museum and business skyline.

8,The Iconic Must Visit Singapore Spot,"People say that you haven't go to Singapore if you don't have your picture in front of the Merlion. Actually this is really just a photo shoot spot for me=) Better come here in the morning, since it will be so hot at noon and hard to take photo due to the sunray. You can have picture with Marina background, Singapore flyer background and also Esplanade. If you like to explore the river you can also ride river cruise. After the hot photo shoot moment, it's so refreshing to take juice or ice cream on the shops along the park. There is a stall selling ice cream with Merlion shape there. If the season is right, you can find Australian sweet cherry sold here too..it tastes so good..but in here the cherries were sold a bit pricy..you can have them cheaper at Fair Price supermarkets. But if you don't have anytime to go to supermarkets, then you can have the cherry here.",en,2020-01-10,anitanur84,Bandung,5,2
8,Beautiful at night,Went along here with my wife one evening after we had been out for a nice meal.

Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Lion Statue, the city center of skyscrapers, the 'floating football pitch', The Helix Bridge and Esplanade - Theaters of The Bay! Don't expect to be particularly lonely though - even though I was here during 'off-season' (well) in November, there were thousands of people on the scene. But it is not a tourist trap (well) but well worth a few minutes of attendance and attention.

54,Crowded but worth the visit,"The Merlion Park is nice during the daytime but spectacular at night. To get here just take a taxi or Grab car to 1, Fullerton and walk down to the waterfront and head left. The Park is actually quite small and there are several restaurants here as well as a Starbucks Coffee. You can also make your way to parts of Singapore River too.  The Merlion has been the most iconic symbol of Singapore for decades, perhaps now taken over by the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. However, it is still extremely popular and in the evening time very crowded with both tourists and locals who come here to wander around the Marina Bay area.  Just beside the Merlion you can join boat rides in the bay and into Singapore River. Also at night time you can get the most spectacular views from Merlion Park of the tall skyscrapers of the financial district and across the Bay towards Marina Bay Sands.

Merlion I was told is a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish. You will see it on all travel brochures and advertisements.   BOTTOM LINE: No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit here. The amount of water coming out of Merlion's mouth is like a large high pressure fire-hose. Depending on the wind direction, you might get wet! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! MY RATION: 10/10.  This location is also excellent for taking photos of the Marina Sands Hotel and the skyline.

The Statues of the ""Merlions"" also include a smaller [about 7 feet tall] ""baby"". The views of the Bay and City are wonderful-- especially at night. The ""Merlion"" has been awarded TripAdvisors' "" Travellers' Choice"" designation. Nearby, one can also find a refreshing ice cream cone... Its a definite ""Must See"" when visiting Singapore.

To its credit, the park actually offers beautiful views of the MBS. You can also catch pretty cool views of it from the other side of the water from the MBS. For a cheap touristy thing to do - and since it is free, why not! I was otherwise not super impressed with it.

The Merlion park is close by the mouth of Singapore river across the Esplanade bridge. The Raffles place MRT station can be used for accessing this location.

81,Not good for the disabled,"It’s a great sight, which everybody wants to see, but serious problems for the disabled, accessibility is really difficult. Others describe it in detail, so I’m concentrating on the problems I faced. Took a bus to Fullerton Square, that was the easy bit. Now we had to cross the road. There’s an underpass from the Fullerton, but there’s no elevator for the disabled, just escalators. We walked some distance to find a suitable surface road crossing. 2 sets of traffic lights, so it took some time. Now we were faced with flights of steps to get to the viewing area. My wife found, after a goodly walk, one smaller flight of steps, with a wheelchair lift (you have to phone to get the staff to help). In the end, we had to walk half across the river and back again on a different bridge to avoid steps. By now we needed the toilet. Full marks, there are two disabled toilets, but oh dear they’re not suitable for many disabled people, because there are no handrails around the toilet. Things were worse than normal when we visited, because there were a lot of ramps to get over power leads for the New Year Display. At least that’s only temporary. The final problem is the many tourists walking around not watching where they are, looking for that perfect picture. It just made things more difficult. Be alert for some steps which are very difficult to spot. No warnings bumps in the pavement for the blind, and no obvious yellow paint to show the edges. If you’re disabled, there are so many good places to visit in Singapore, I think it’s best to give this one a miss. See the Merlion from across the river, or from other places around the Marina.",en,2019-01-29,HeatSeekerWrexham_UK,"Wrexham, United Kingdom",2580,248

One is quite big, while the other is small, both facing opposite directions.  A visit to Singapore is incomplete without visiting Merlion. Since we missed the chance to visit Sentosa Merlion, we decided to walk up to Merlion Park from Sands Skypark Observation Deck entrance located at Hotel Tower 3 of the MBS Hotel.  It is a bit crowded, but it is natural to expect a crowd, for it offers a very good photo opportunity. People take photos, cupping their hands together and making it appear in the photos that the water is falling straight into the cupped hands.  Worth visiting, but don't specially plan to visit it solely.

If you’re wanting a view with the lion and Marina Bay Sands in the background, you will get the back of the lion with a plethora of selfie taking individuals in the foreground.

110,It's a statue with a great view,"There are a lot of strange mythical animals around the world. I am sure you have heard of centaurs, unicorns, dragons and even phoenixes before. In Singapore, we have our very own mythical creature too and it's none other than the Merlion!  Born with the head of a lion and the body of a mermaid (don't ask me how that happened, we're still trying to figure that out), the Merlion is the tourism ambassador of Singapore. The official Merlion can be found at the centre of the city-state, between the Marina Bay tourist area.  It guards the entrance to the Singapore river, overlooking popular tourist destinations like the Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer and is within a short walk away from the Fullerton Hotel and the National Gallery Singapore.  The Merlion enjoys spewing water out from its mouth most of the day, for reasons we are also still unsure of. Maybe it's because of all the partying nights. Legends say that in the night, the Merlion will quietly slip to Clarke Quay, Singapore's premier clubbing and drinking district to wind down after a tough day of being a tourist attraction.  Clarke Quay is also not that far too, only around 1-kilometre walk along the river.  Jokes aside, if you are considering to visit the Merlion, bear in mind that it's only a statue overlooking the Marina Bay area. There are some cafes nearby for you to sit down and enjoy the view, or you can choose to sit near the steps of the Merlion, but there's not much else to do here other than to take photos and enjoy the view.  If you fully want to enjoy the Marina Bay experience and see the Merlion from a different angle, I suggest taking the river cruise that allows you to tour the different landmarks along Singapore River. If I remember correctly, you can also embark and disembark at different pickup points. But check with the counter first.  Or if you're feeling adventurous and don't mind a little walking, you can choose to walk along the bay area and visit several landmarks at one go. There's the Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, the Art Science Museum and Marina Bay Sands all within walking distance. Might take you half a day to one full day to cover everything.  Singapore's weather can get quite hot or rainy so bring an umbrella just in case.",en,2018-10-24,dori_lukey,"Singapore, Singapore",658,2213

114,A Crowded Place To See An Average Sculpture ,"One of the reasons we decided to go into the city and leave Changi airport was because of the Merlion. I’d seen so many pictures of this creature all over the airport on postcards, cookies, and more. It seems like such an important part of this cities identity. Certainly we wanted to see other parts of the city, but this was one I couldn’t miss... or so I thought.  I can’t tell you what I was expecting, but I can say that I was disappointed. It’s a very crowded waterfront park with a large cement sculpture spitting water. The sculpture isn’t overly detailed or that impressive. There’s no information about what it represents or why it’s ever there. The one nice feature is that there’s a slightly nicer, smaller version of the sculpture behind the large Merlion that’s worth seeing.

128,The Most Iconic Image of This Southeast Asian City State,"Without a doubt, the most identifiable image of the country, and commonly seen in brochures, ads, and even on fighter jets (as seen at the Air Force Museum).  Set right on the waterfront, this little showcase is a must see when visiting, and this was only my second trip to it since I first saw it way back in November of 2009.  However, this time, I got wonderful night shots (and with a much better camera than the last time).  This installation is cool to see too, because the downtown area of the city creates and awesome backdrop (although I think I'd say it looks cooler at just before sundown with just enough light in the sky plus the statue, plus the lights from the buildings in the background).  However, as previously mentioned by many others, yes, as this IS probably the most emblematic landmark in the country, it's going to attract quite a crowd and thus, there will most likely be many many people there all taking their selfies and group pictures in both the day or night. However, it's not like you can't get good pictures in between as most were very considerate of others who are also trying to get their own memorable snapshots.  Also, if one gets off at the City Hall MRT, follow maps, and even street signs, you can easily reach the Merlion, is a great place for a photo shoot and admission is completely free!

It's rather a little square overlooking the Marina Bay with a fountain statue (actually 2 statues since there is a smaller statue in the back) right in the middle. The fountain statue though represents the symbol of Singapore, the Merlion, combining the ties between the island and its people to the sea, as well as the historic name the ""Lion city"" in malayan that is ironically the old name given to a place where lions never existed! This Merlion was allocated in the mouth of the Singapore river but it was relocated here in 2002 and it sprays the water right back to the bay As usual in Singapore, you better visit by night to enjoy the lights and the atmosphere and definitely this place is on your way while visiting the Marina Bay, and for sure it is a great idea to get some photos with the fountain in the background sending its water right over your head or directly in your mouth ;)",en,2018-08-31,S9788OVmohameds,"Alexandria, Egypt",725,66

There’s very little personal space and if someone can squeeze in front of you, they probably will. That’s not rudeness, that’s simply how it’s done...don’t get upset. Do be aware, however, that you’ll have to spend some time waiting to get that perfect photo.  Gift shops in the immediate area are obscenely expensive. A small wood Merlion statue was $88; you can get a similar one in almost any tourist store for less than $10.

142,Take some photos of the Merlions,"This attraction is right on the harbour, standing on reclaimed land. The big Merlion; named Mama Merlion, is the original one which stood on the waterfront (before the big land reclamation project), standing behind her is The Cub (a female, they say) and the only Merlion facing away from the sea. This is a fun place to take photos, and there are plentiful near-by places where you can get a cool drink. In reply to the Trip Advisor questions about fees and dress standard: there are no fees to pay at any Merlion venue. Common sense dictates that you dress reasonably wherever you go in Singapore... the locals don't particularly want to see visitors in grubby / skimpy outfits. What next?! Now that you've met Mama Merlion and The Cub, you should walk up to the top of Mt Faber to meet Elder Brother Merlion... and of course you'll take a trip to Sentosa Island; the ideal opportunity to meet one more member of the family; Papa Merlion. There's another, rather diminutive, Merlion at the Tourist Info Centre. If you have an inquiring mind, you can do the research on the computer and find two unofficial Merlions guarding the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Grove, and three unofficial Merlions in Woodlands; two are in front of a garden shop / plant nursery, where you can meet the gent who created them! And one more just around the corner in a sort of Merlion shrine. Having done all that, you'll want to visit the Mustafa Centre; the discount department store near MRT Bugis which is open 24 hr / day.

It is also the closest where you get to the Merlion. Instagram worthy but also rather crowded. Light shows on the bay every night - a bit touristy but they love it nonetheless.   I usually take them for dinner at Palm beach Seafood restaurant to enjoy chili crab and pretty good food. A bit more pricey than usual but food is good and it has a great view outside. It’s usually packed. so book in advance to sit outside to enjoy the view.   In the day, nice place to enjoy beer, coffee etc at the many al fresco cafes and take in all the activities in the bay - sports, river boat cruise etc. If it gets too warm or too wet, sit inside the air-conditioned areas. I like the Ps Cafe on Level 2. To get there, take a cab to One Fullerton or walk from the nearest train station or bus stop. It’s also a nice walk from the Marina Bay Shoppes (where the hotel is) to One Fullerton (just follow the Merlin spouting water at the opposite end) - a scenic 15 minute walk.   From One Fullerton you can also take the basement travellator to the Fullerton Hotel - which used to be the General post office, a relic left from the British which was conserved and converted to a spectacular hotel. Around that district, wander around and you find more conserved properties beautifully restored and maintained which are now museums, concert halls and galleries.

So rather than being a historic representation of the City it’s a glorified souvenir. In saying that the 8.5m high statute, erected in 1972, is one of the most recognised statues in the world. It seems that everybody who visits Singapore ends up with a least one photo of the Merlion. Located at Merlion Park on Marina Bay, in front of the Fullerton Hotel, there is a pier extending alongside allowing you to take photos of it from all angles. There tends to be a crowd no matter what time during the day that you visit. If you take a bumboat tour you can even take photos of it from the water.

Therefore, this activity alone wouldn't be worth it if is wasn't so close to Clark Quay or the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

Originally, the statue was located at the mouth of the Singapore River but it was moved to its present location in 2002 to allow it to be viewed from the waterfront away from the bridge that was blocking the view.

It was a good few hours (spent wholly at The Shoppes shopping centre at Marina Bay Sands) before the rain died down enough for us to venture out.  We crossed the Helix Bridge (arguably an attraction in it's own right - if you're into bridges and architecture), which took us by various other sights such as The Float (world's largest floating stadium and stage), The Bay Grandstand, The Esplanade Outdoor Theatre, The Waterfront Promenade, and the Esplanade Bridge, before we reached the Merlion situated in Merlion Park.  Now, I've read reviews of how busy the place it, however, we went around lunchtime on a Tuesday, and it wasn't nearly as rammed as I've been led to believe that it could get. We easily took our pictures of and with the Merlion, and helped others take theirs without much bother.  Was it worth waiting out the rain to visit? I want to an emphatic ""yes"", but I can't. I can't say that its worth spending a great day of time or effort to get to, but that said, I am glad that we went, if only to tick something off our list.  The park itself is quite nice, and you can see some stunning views, but after visiting something like The Garden by the Bay, most other park type areas pale in comparison.",en,2017-12-07,ReviewChimp,,458,242

274,Great way to start a visit to Singapore,"This is the symbol of the City with good reason. It sits now in Marina Bay after having been moved there about 20 years ago. Half lion, half fish. I went in late afternoon and then hung around at the Starbucks a block from there so as to see it again lit up in the Harbor.   There are some great view points in front and around the side of the symbol. There are loads and loads of tourists all wanting the same photo you want too. It works out ok if you are patient, you can always get your favorite shot.  The Park is easy to get to walking or by other transpo, to me it was fun to explore that whole area, including the nearby very well noted hotels. I also tied this visit with a trip to tour the Singapore River, there is a river tour stop within 100 meters of Merlion.   Also, this is a decent viewpoint to watch the light show, it will be crowded but the light show is really across the Bay at the Sands. Fun to see it though from this perspective too.

Very tall, very heavy, and very white, giving it a major presence within the park but also completely flooded with tourists which can make private photos with a loved one a bit of a challenge.

313,A must-see destination in Singapore!,"Singapore is just a stone's throw away from the Philippines! One gets there within four hours from Manila or three hours and a half from Cebu by plane. One place I would recommend for first-time visitors would be the Merlion Park in the Marina Bay area. It offers you a wonderful view of the modern city, overlooking the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade (mall and theater), skyscrapers, and so forth.  One must-see monument in the area, of course, is the water-spitting Merlion statue. It has become the symbol of Singapore itself since the country gained independence from the English crown way back in 1965. It depicts a mythological creature, half-fish (reminding us of the humble beginnings of Singapore as a fishing village) and half-lion (representing the local people's bravery and capacity to make giant leaps towards modernity). Another story has it that when the first Malay inhabitants arrived in the bay, they encountered a lion in the fishing village, which explains the half-fish, half-lion image.   There are many Merlion statues in Singapore. You may also want to visit Sentosa Island for a bigger version of it. However, the one at Merlion Park, which stands 8.6 meters tall, offers a more scenic view -- ideal for photo ops (although the area often gets quite crowded during the day). There is also a baby Merlion statue right behind the bigger one in the same area.  Once you get to Merlion Park, walk your way around the whole bay area until you reach Marina Bay Sands hotel on the other side, and from there cross over to visit another famous tourist spot in the city: the Gardens by the Bay.  Merlion Park is an open-air destination, so no need to pay. To get there, the easiest way is to take the MRT and get off at Raffles station and follow the signs to the park.",en,2017-07-11,CzarEmmanuel,"Manila, Philippines",5080,567

There are a few spots to eat, but frankly if you visit this famous tourist attraction, that's probably not your number one reason for visiting. This park is easily accessible by MRT, taxi or Uber(cheaper option after the MRT).

You don't know the legend of the lion? Ok, no problem, here it is: ""In the 14th century, the prince of Sumatra of the hindu Kingdom Sri Vjaya married the princess of the buddhist Kingdom of Mjapahir. Later on he got in trouble because of it and had to flee from Sumatra to Temasek (the city at the sea). On his way, he met a lion in the jungle. He was scared and he was ready to fight him, but after a while staring at themselves, they saw themselves at equal, turned around and passed each other. The prince was so fascinated of that encounter, he decided to rename the city of Temasek to Singapore (Singha = Lion; pura = city). From that moment onwards the landmark of Singapore was the ""Merlion"", half lion because of his strength and half mermaid to show the closeness to the sea. The mistake in that story would be that at this time there were no lions in this area, so it probably was a tiger!""",en,2017-05-10,JornsenOnTheRoad,"Basel, Switzerland",4,2

I will say that there were only a few times we went past that there weren't hoards of tourists there so getting the perfect photo is a challenge.  We also went right by the large Merlion on the night time river cruise. We got to see the Merlion from a different perspective and seeing as we caught a late boat about 9:15pm, there were only a few people onboard. The boat cruise is a paid activity 25$S per person I believe and some counters are cash only.

There are great views of the harbour and the city skyline from the other side towards the F1 pit straight.  The restaurants and bars along the walk are overpriced; don't bother paying $20 for a beer there when you can get one for $8 less than ten minutes away - that is just stupid. Other than that, the walkway was rather pleasant on an afternoon and provided a surprisingly calming trip. The Merlion area itself is obviously a lot busier, but stepping away from the viewing platform and down towards the water offers a different viewpoint that most seem to ignore.

The Marina Bay Hotel & Singapore Flyer on the other side, Esplanade just a short distance away, and boats floating in the Singapore river, present a view that make a lasting image.

But it is a must see place. And when we went there, to ogle at it, truly the hordes were a plenty. This speaks volumes of the significance of doing a pilgrimage to the Merlion.

The statue is facing the water on the lake, and the area is surrounded with many tall buildings .

Walking some more led us to One Fullerton in which its far end is the famous Merlion Statue, which throws out water straight to the Singapore River. They say you haven’t been to Singapore if you haven’t been to this place – at least this time as far as that standard is concerned, I can claim of being in Singapore. Groups of tourists, mostly Koreans, troop to this spot to have their photo with Singapore’s iconic Merlion. Also overlooking for the statue were equally famous landmarks such as the Esplanade Theatre by the bay on the left and the recently opened Marina Bay Sands at the other side of the river.

Most people will say “If you haven’t snapped a picture with the Merlion, means you never really come to Singapore!” hahaa.. Is it true?  I have been to this place for a few times and still find it beautiful. It’s beautiful at daytime or nightime. If you come on peak season, sure you will squeeze with lots of tourists.   So, what can you do here? 1. Snap pictures – Oh, this is a MUST. Snap as many pictures as you can with lots of creative poses.  2. Enjoy the View – Everything around here is worth to see. Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade theatre, Waterfront Promenade, or the Merlion itself. It will be nicer at nighttime if you want to feel the vibe. 3. Eat at nearby restaurant – There’re quite lots of restaurant around the Merlion Park. You can sit there, enjoy your dine and at the same time you can enjoy the viber around Merlion too.

You might have to change 2-3 buses depending on where you are staying, but it's worth it. I was blown away!)  You can view the Esplanade, the Flyer, the ArtScience Museum and Marina Bay Sands from here and it is an amazing photo op!  (Tip: try to take a photo of the Merlion Park from the other side, i.e., from either the top of the Singapore Flyer or the roof of Marina Bay Sands. You can look at other humans flitting about like little ants!)  The only downside I can think of is that the place is going to be crowded no matter what time you go. But do not miss this one for anything.  P.S: Just make sure you carry an umbrella or a raincoat with you. The weather here is unpredictable and the unexpected showers drenched us thoroughly.

706,Must do for the photo ops!,"Is it the best of places in Singapore to visit? No Is it a must-visit place while you are on a short trip here? Absolutely yes! This in short is my review of the Merlion Park. The Merlion statue itself will leave you underwhelmed, but go there for: 1. The must-do photo-op with the most recognized tourist symbol of Singapore 2. Enjoy the Marina Bay Promenade and especially the laser show from MBS (Look up Marina Bay Sands web site for the exact timings of the laser show before you plan your trip) 3. Hop into one of the many restaurants and places to drink nearby 4. Take a boat ride on the Singapore river to or from the Merlion park 5. Walk over from Merlion Park to the Esplanade area  Note that Merlion Park is not a standalone area, it is one among the many attractions in the Marina Bay promenade area and should be clubbed with other activities. There are a number of itineraries that I can suggest, pick whatever suits you best:  a. Starting from Clarke Quay: Get down at Clarke Quay, visit one of the many pubs in the area and get on a boat to the Merlion Park. Time the visit so that you can view the MBS laser shown while on the boat b. Gardens by the Bay -> Merlion Park -> Esplanade: This can be quite a long and tiring activity and will easily require half a day. Catch the sound and light show at Gardens By the Bay --> Walk over to Marina Bay Sands --> Catch a boat from MBS to Merlion Park or take the longer route of walking from MBS to Merlion Park --> If you still have enough energy, walk over to Promenade from Merlion and have dinner at Promenade c. Boat Quay to Merlion Park: Visit one of the pubs in Boat Quay --> Walk over to Merlion seeing the Asian Civilisation Museum and Fullerton Hotel --> Or take one of the boats that come from Clarke Quay --> Go over to Promenade after visiting Merlion Park  So, while Merlion Park itself has nofthing much to offer, it has to be part of your Singapore tour itinerary and club it together with your half day visit to the Marina Bay area!",en,2015-12-16,JCVEN,"Singapore, Singapore",42,21

712,Universal studios ,The park is vast and within it is universal studios. It's very good but not as good as Orlando by a long shot. A small bottle of water will set you back £3 but they do have the odd drinking fountain you can top up with. The transport system in Singapore is the best I've seen. So easy and cheap to navigate. From the airport to anywhere via the train system is fool proof.

713,"Come at night too, for a vastly different experience....","The Merlion is an iconic symbol of Singapore. It is a beautiful creature- half lion, half fish.   The Merlion Park is located in the city, easily accessible via buses & 3 MRT stations ie City Hall ( this is an Interchange station), Promenade & Esplanade ( both Circle Line).  It is about 10 mins walk from City Hall or Esplanade stations. Promenade is further. It is also accessible via Raffles Place station but harder to find for those unfamiliar with the place.  When out of these 2 stations, the first unique structure that catches your eye is The Esplanade Theatre building ie "" The Durian.""  Walk towards the direction of the Shenton Way office buildings.   You can't miss these many prominent skyscraper buildings sitting so close to each other. As you walk towards there, you will see Marina Bay Sands on the left. And the Merlion is visible  The night scene & atmosphere is very different from the day. Amidst the coolness & huge expanse of the big dark sky above, the dimly lighted environment and the background of so many beautifully lighted up Marina Bay/Shenton Way buildings 'hugging' each other- one can feel the awesomeness of tranquility, beauty & 'freedom.'   It is a romantic place for couples to just relax & spend time together. We come here regularly just to enjoy all these & spend quality time as a couple.  The many colourful Singapore River Cruise boats plying the bay below with tourists snapping away adds lively colour amidst the dark sea.  Oh yes. There is a cute Baby Merlion just few metres behind the main Merlion. You might missed it in the night as it dim.",en,2015-12-01,Travelove58,,9521,441

But it was worth visiting there, as I enjoyed a walk around the bay seeing Marina Bay Sands and its light show. Maybe it would be good idea to take a boat cruise and see Merlion from the different angle. If I remember things correct, the walking path around the bay is about 3.5km or so.

When we went, around 5.30pm, there was no water gushing out from the Merlion either. That made the display even less appreciable.",en,2015-11-21,satwikh,Chennai,26,6

719,Better at Night,"The main thing I was struck by, upon revisiting the Merlion, was how incredibly small it was - we then realised that my childhood recollection of it probably referred to the Sentosa Merlion which is, of course, much bigger. However, I recommend coming here at night as the city is well lit up and there is a great view across the water to Marina Bay Sands.

742,A great viewpoint :),"This is actually not a park in a traditional sense with plants & flowers, and it's not too spacious of an area either, but to be seen while one stands here near the iconic ""landmark"" Merlion which is on a corner of land bordering the Marina Bay is a panoramic view of the bay with other great ""landmarks"" on the other corners of land touching the bay such as Marina Bay Sands hotel with the SkyPark on top in the shape of a 'boat deck', Singapore Flyer with the peculiar-shaped Helix Bridge nearby and Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay with two ""durians"" (or two halves of just one) on top; also, right behind this area is the historic Fullerton Hotel which is on one end of a pretty long stretch of the super tall buildings of the central financial district. And, if you're here in the evening after dark, the feeling is just surreal with everything lit up all around you including the jet stream of water (or part of it) coming out of the mouth of the Merlion! :) Also, to enjoy either viewing from here or from a little distance to the right in front of One Fullerton are laser beams coming across the water from the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel as part of the 8 pm and 9 or 9 30 pm ""Wonder Full"" show.  One way to get here (the way I did but can't say if it's the best way) by public transportation is taking the MRT to Raffles Place station (green & red lines), then walk about 10 minutes underground and come out of the building on the corner of the boardwalk & Marina Boulevard, and then walk along the boardwalk in the direction toward Fullerton Bay Hotel (and go past it) for about another 10 minutes.",en,2015-10-16,myom624,"Coquitlam, Canada",15714,526

744,A Testament to how far Singapore has come,"The Merlion Park isn't a real park in the sense that there isn't much greenery and it isn't a huge open space. However it is a lovely place to just soak in the amazing view of the Singapore skyline. It is a testament to how far Singapore has come from its days as a small trading port. As the port got busier, the Singapore River got dirtier to the extent that a blind person on a bus would know when the bus is near the Singapore River because of the stench. So the massive operation to clean her up began and took TEN WHOLE YEARS. Today, the Singapore River is clean and the pride of many Singaporeans. You can take a bumboat ride from Clark Quay (or several other pick-up points) which will allow you to enjoy the view of the Merlion from the front as opposed to only its side view from the park.   There are lots of FnB options available at along the riverfront, good places to enjoy a good meal or just chill and watch the world go by.   Later in the evening, there is laser show, best viewed from the bridge connecting the Merlion Park to the Esplanade.

Soft lighting on the Merlion and its surrounds it looked very romantic in the night lights. During the day we had seen it from the on off bus so wanted to look closer.

Near raffles place MRT, lots of history behind the lion-fish statue.   Some history: The Merlion is a combination of 2 animals, head of a lion and body of a fish (represents SG origins as a fishing village), very unique and the setting near Marina Bay is breathtaking.  SG's original name was Singapura or ""lion city"" (Malay). It is interesting in that it faces East, a direction that signifies prosperity (where the fountain showers water from its mouth). There are 5 of these figures in SG, 2 in Merlion Park and the others at Mt. Faber, Sentosa and the Tourism. (details info from visitacity.com-- a great website to help you plan trips!) Highly recommended and great for fun pics.  After merlion park, we walked to Lau Pasat for some satay and a variety of dishes at this very famous food court.

Beautiful views from just about every angle. But taking pictures could be quite a challenge here since the place is packed with visitors almost all day long, especially in the evening. An important tip for photography lovers if you wish to avoid the crowd: visit in the morning before 8am as we did the day after our evening visit. There was practically nobody there! Very much in contrast with our visit the previous evening. This did not last long though, as the tour groups started arriving just shortly after 8am as we were leaving.",en,2015-04-30,ST4347,"Jakarta, Indonesia",517,105

826,Great photo opportunities,"One of the attractions that can not be missed. The sculpture is only few meters high, but is located in a great place to photo Marina Bay and MBS as a background.   We went on foot from MBS along the bay, about 20-30 minutes walking, fantastic photo opportunities. On the way back we had a boat trip across the river, the ticket price was SGD5 and it took less then 10 minutes to get to MBS. The boat station is some metres from the Merlion sculpture.  We went there in the afternoon and it was very crowded. Avoid this time of the day, if possible.",en,2015-04-30,light9,"Sofia, Bulgaria",116,58

826,Do visit to get a feel of Singapore,"If you are in Singapore and have just one evening to explore, i suggest that you choose this place. This is the iconic place in where the mascot of Singapore , the Merlion is placed.   The park is more of concrete walk ways and sitting areas lining the bay, and a few trees here and there. You can just walk about in the park looking at all the other fellow travelers. You also get a good view of the durian shaped esplanade, and Marina Bay Sands(The place with the three towers and the pool/garden on top of it).  There are quite a few restaurants nearby with open air seating areas. Most of them open for dinner at 6. But they start serving drinks by around 5.30, some of them even earlier.   The Singapore flyer is just a short walk from here, so after exploring Merlion park you can walk over to the Flyer. Tip: On the way to Singapore Flyer from there, look out for the guy selling yummy ice cream sandwiches in a handcart. And if you do find him, choose the blueberry flavor :-)",en,2015-04-29,HalfAGingerTea,"Bengaluru, India",78,32

It's amazing how technically this statue is physically just a water feature, yet it has a purpose built viewing platform that sticks out over the water, due to the huge crowd it attracts!   And everyone there at the time we visit, we're so happy, all smiling and finding the perfect position for the perfect photo. It was really nice to be amongst it.   So it's not a water feature, but an amazing statue full of character and a Singapore 'Must See!' .

Finding the merlion park is quite tricky though, since it's a bit hidden, surrounded by many tall buildings.  I visited it after I visited Asian Civilizations Museum. From the museum, take a left and walk through an underpass, then turn right and cross an old bridge. After crossing a bridge, you will find the nameplate of merlion park on your left, a bit small but surely can be found easily. Just enter the park, and go under a big fly over bridge, and there you are, a merlion statue in front of famous marina bay sands building.  The statue is smaller than in my imagination, but a merlion is a merlion. It is the most iconic of Singapore and a must visit, just because.

Prior to visiting we didn't really know much about the place and didn't really have any icons or symbols to associate with it but thanks to the Merlion, now we do! With limited time (and money) (and the fact that we were jetlagged!) we didn't want to do anything too expensive or difficult to plan during our short time there so checking out the Merlion was straightforward, free and not too onerous. We visited once during the middle of the day and again in the early evening. If you are bothered by the heat as I am I suggest going in the early evening while it is still light (we were there in Summer) as there is not a lot of shade near the statue. You have to be fairly patient when it comes to getting a good photo because there are always a lot of other people trying to do the same thing but this is not unusual for landmarks. Walk right around the Marina to view it from every angle but allow a bit of time for this as it's a longer walk than it appears to be and by the end we had to rush a bit to get back to the statue for photos while it was still daylight.",en,2015-04-03,Aussie_Binturong,"Queensland, Australia",181,105

We then made our way to a Chinese temple, Thian Hock Temple and drove through the streets of Singapore with good narration and information provided by the tour guide.

842,A great River Cruise.,"A visit to the Merlion Park is a MUST. This is an icon of Singapore and is ideally situated at the end of a promenade which is full of restaurants and fast food outlets offering various cuisines. We went in the afternoon and found it idea to take pictures with the sun BEHIND us. 2 Ferry operators offer very similar trips of about 45 mins. duration each. The one cruising the Bay and out to the Barrage offered little else than a slow trip on the water. But the one cruising up the Singapore River is highly recommended. A very good Video and commentary highlights the scenes as one cruises past, enhanced by the total lack of engine noise and vibration, as the motor is electric. One also has the option to HOP-ON/HOP-OFF at the various stops if you have the time for it, to explore both sides of the River Banks, full of shops & eateries of all types, or staying on board for the round trip.

844,Disappointing,"The Merlion is so important to Singapore - but the setting for the monument is so tacky. As you proceed towards it, from the main road / bridge, you even find an even tackier plastic version that is part of a cafe's advertising. So many tourists believe that this is the Merlion and have their photo taken by it. The local council, or whatever the Singapore administrative body is, should have refused permission for this and made sure that the Merlion is in an appropriate setting. The background view of the three buildings with the ""boat"" on top is spectacular.

868,Campy & Touristy Fun On Marina Bay,"This is one of the craziest sensations I have experienced in a while. When you witness tourists from all over the world ogling and shooting pictures like crazy of themselves with a cement red-eyed, 8.6 meter statue of a combination mermaid or fish/lion, the Merlion, famous icon of Singapore, then you have not experienced how a tourist attraction can provoke people do strange things in large crowds. I have never seen so many people, of all ages, laughing hard and pretending in the photo they about to take, that the Merlion is shooting it's massive stream of water into their mouths. What do you expect for a free but famous attraction?  There is a lot of construction with a new pedestrian bridge being built for direct access into Merlion Park so watch the detours accordingly.   The walkway by the statue jetted out over Marina Bay which made the access for nice photos great with less people in the shots. The park is built with other pedestrian walkways around a chunk of Marina Bay and has more to offer than just the Merlion with a giant fountain coming out of its mouth. There is a mini Merlion in ceramic and nice landscaping and concrete chill out areas with little ice cream and coffee shops.  This statue is so dominate that you can see it from the top of the Marina Bay Sands and across the bay at ground level. The lights make it even prettier at night with flashes of purples, pinks and yellows.   We walked to Merlion Park from the south side of the bay by Helix Bridge, past the Esplanade, and to the park. After we went to Merlion Park we went north under the very busy Fullerton Road to the Fullerton Hotel and enjoyed the views of the Singapore River.

Merlion Park is free, you have nice views looking back at the Raffles Place Skyline, it's nice to get down by the water, and there are some great photo opportunities (it's a selfie paradise!!).  Much has changed with the vista since I was here 7 years ago as the Marina Bay Sands now dominates the skyline opposite the Merlion and the Singapore Flyer was added too since I was last here... But all good visual additions making the trip to Merlion Park even more worthwhile.  Simply don't visit Singapore without going to say hello to the Merlion!

899,Great!,"Although I am a Singaporean, I hardly have the time to really visit and appreciate this iconic place of interest. I remember I once sent some relatives here to visit but it was so rush and never even had a nod with the Merlion.   Few days ago, I happened to attend a 2 day course at the nearby Plaza and came here for a visit early in the morning on the 2nd day of the course. The MRT ride was free as I alighted Raffles Place MRT station before 7.45 am. In fact, I was at the Merlion Park at about 7.15 am.   At this hour, the place was not crowded with tourists. You have the full leisure of time to walk casually along the boardway behind Fullerton Bay Hotel to the Merlion Park and slowly admiring the beautiful sunrise that was emerging out of the background of Marina Sands building. The sea was extremely calm and the weather was fine. The view at the Merlion Park was awesome and the metropolis background splendid. It was a relaxing stroll though you could still hear the sound of the car horns and noisy buses plying along Fullerton Road. I took some photos of the sunrise and the Merlion Park and proceeded to the Esplanade and walked to the floating platform (where the National Day event was held annually).   I was perspiring but my eyes and heart were captivated by the sea view as I looked from the floating platform. As the sun shone its morning ray towards the sky scrapers, the sea and the merlion park, the whole scenery was so wonderfully awesome that I kept taking repetitive shots of the place.   It was a different feeling enjoying a scenery with a natural setting and a setting of a magnificient metropolis city but the contentment and joy in appreciating the beauty appears to be the same.  It is a must see iconic place of interest in Singapore.   I will come again but will choose different times of the day - noon and night!.",en,2014-07-11,soh_kien_peng,"Singapore, Singapore",6170,2988
899,Great attraction.  Go early if you want great pictures.,"The Merlion is a must see icon. Took me quite a bit of effort to get this information but I managed to find out (from the Singapore tourist hotline) that whilst the park is open 24 hours, the merlion only sprouts water from 0630 - 0000 hrs (weekdays) and 0630 - 0300 hrs on weekends..

We visited it twice - the first time in the morning, and the second time in the evening to experience Wonder Full. Both the experiences were awesome.   It is advisable to visit the place in the evenings rather than the mornings as the city more or less comes to life in the evenings.

901,Crowded and over-rated,I first visited Singapore in 1998. The Merlion stood proudly on a small island guarding the entrance to the City. Since then the authorities have moved it back about 100 yards and have developed the area considerably. The Merlion is now surrounded by tourists and approached from the back where previously you could see it 'face on'. There is an extremely pleasant and ever expanding water front walk (from Fullerton Hotel all the way down to the Merlion). This should be experienced both during the day and at night. At night the Merlion is illuminated a stark white colour.

912,Symbol of Singapore,"If you had a limited time to visit Singapore, you should at least get a picture with the gigantic Merlion. Getting there is easy enough, and is a walk from the Raffles MRT. Sadly, there are no big signs for tourists, so you'll have to rely on your map. Even if you do check the map, you might go every which way (and I got confused myself the first time), so let me give all tourists some advice to get there (if you're commuting via MRT):  1) Exit via Exit A or B 2) Go through Chevron House. At the end, you'll arrive at the road. 3) Cross the road via the foot bridge, which connects to the front of Fullerton Bay Hotel 4) Turn left and keep walking that way. By this time, you'll have a lot of opportunities to take pictures of the great view of Marina Bay. My advice is to keep walking, as you'll have a lot more opportunities while walking towards the Merlion. This advice isn't heeded at all, usually, so just have fun as you walk and follow the bay. 5) At the end of that walk you'll find the Merlion  The moment you arrive in front of Fullerton Bay Hotel, you'll probably just keep taking pictures all the way towards the Merlion, so just enjoy (no matter the Singapore heat). As an iconic statue that symbolizes Singapore, I think any tourist should come by and visit. So that your visit is not wasted, keep in mind that this is around Marina Bay, and you can definitely walk to Esplanade and have dinner at Gluttons By the Bay, or if it's still early, keep on walking and you'll end up at Marina Bay Sands.

912,An Icon,"The Merlion is something interesting to see as part of our walk from Chinatown to Raffles Hotel. This icon should not be missed. This is comparable to Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is interesting to view but not sit and contemplate for hours. In the ten minutes we were there, we easily had our photos taken mid afternoon on this April Tuesday.",en,2014-04-29,haroldh967,"Anaheim, California",358,154
912,Best Place to See Marina Bay Sands,"The landmark of SIngapore City at the bank of Marina Bays. Everyone who visits Singapore must go to this place. Simply go there from Raffles Place MRT station.

913,Nice area of downtown,"The statue is unique and quite the tourist attraction. We fought through the crowds at ground level to get a picture. It is quite difficult to get an unobstructed picture. Everyone is trying to pose on the viewing platform and get a picture taken. It is quite obnoxious what some people try to do in their poses. Some were doing hand stands, taking those stupid pictures of trying to jump up in the air and time it just right. It can be a crazy area. We later took a boat tour of the harbor, and we got an unobstructed view from the water. These were some good pictures. It's very touristy. It's free. Expect the crowds.",en,2014-04-27,MelandGeo,"Saint Louis, Missouri",233,101
913,You simply have to go otherwise you weren't in Singapore,"OK lets get this straight. This is a large Merlion statue (one of five 'official' Merlions apparently) and it has water that blows out its mouth. Which on the face of it isn't that awesome. I mean the thing is big but not mammoth so it won't impress you by sheer size or anything. And it doesn't move or do anything.... apart from blow water out of its mouth in an unfaltering stream.  But if you don't go there and have your own particular charmless smile (or maybe you DO have a charming smile) then you weren't really in Singapore were you. The iconic angle of the Merlion looking over towards the awesomely impressive Marina Bay Sands. The iconic angle of the same Merlion with the financial powerhouse of the Singapore CBD behind it. The iconic angle of the Merlion with 'Durian fruit' theatre in the background. I mean, just go with the flow, join the tourist hordes and turn off your inner cynic and enjoy it.  There are nearby facilities and a very well stocked gift store, a couple of casual eateries with friendly staff and it is right near Anderson Bridge which is your gateway to the Asian Civilisations Museum.

The Merlion is the Symbol of Singapore!,"While you might think that everything is dominated by the towers of the Marina Bay Sands complex, the Merlion is still the symbolic spirit of Singapore. He has a new coat of paint and he is offset by the back drop of the harbour and said towers. The walk there through the park is lovely although much like the little mermaid in Copenhagen, you'll find it difficult to get a photo without a strangers head in it...packed with tourists but hey, if you're going there, you're a tourist too!

We went twice, and had dinner in or near City Link Mall or Raffles Place, then walked through and came out by the Theatres by the Bay. From Merlion Park you really appreciate how distinctive the skyline of this city is. The crowds are kind of annoying, but I suspect this would have been ten times worse during the day.

917,"Nice, but way too crowded","Merlion Park is basically just there for tourists, and as such is incredibly crowded. Probably the most crowded area in Singapore, actually, on a pound for pound basis.  A little known fact is that there is also a baby Merlion in the same area, but of course the main attraction is the big one that spits water into Marina Bay. You can get great views across the Marina to Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Singapore Flyer, and the Esplanade theatres from here, and it is especially wise to visit at night so you can see the illuminations that occur, especially at MBS. Regarding food and drink at Merlion Park, well there is various small cafes, and a bar or two, although most of these bars are actually part of the One Fullerton complex, and not suitable for families with children.  Merlion Park continues under the bridge and all the way up to the Fullerton Hotel. There is also a Starbucks nearby with free wifi.

It was surprisingly smaller than I expected it to be, but it was still imposing. There's a viewing deck where you can take the best shots with the Merlion or the Marina Bay Sands as your background.

The place is swarming with tourists during the day and apart from having to endure the sweltering heat, you also have to fight your way through the crowds to get a decent look at the statue.

Evening just before sunset will give you best of both worlds - you can see around all the buildings in natural light as well as wait till the night lights of the city come on (and it gets even more beautiful).

The sight is spectacular especially late into the afternoon and at night.However, the place can be crowded with tourists, and it never runs out of people. Crowds stay in the area for hours, and it can get a bit noisy as well.  If you want to just take a photo of the merlion statue, without having to compete with other tourists and scuffling with crowds of people, take the Singapore River Cruise from Clarke Quay or Boat Quay instead. The bumboat stops for a short while near the statue and from here, you can take photos from the boat without much obstruction from the crowd.

I could read English signs but there was not a single one in sight or direction to be found that we need to get off at Resorts World in order to go to the aquarium. When the bus passed by the Merlion once more we realized that we just turned around and going back to where we came from. The driver announced that he reach the end of the line and stopping for some time. We told him that we are going to the aquarium, ""that was in Resorts World"", he replied. We did not see any signs or hear any announcement in the bus.....I was upset and got off and make our way to board another bus. The driver followed us and explained....I told him that it does not make sense, we’ve been to a lot bigger amusement parks like Universal in Hollywood, Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim....and we never get lost....why here?

955,"Extremely crowded, but worth a visit at least once","The Merlion is a Singapore mascot and a mythical creature with the head of a lion & body of a fish. The lion head represents Singapore's origins to be a ""lion city"" {it's said that the first beast the person who founded Singapore saw was a lion, hence the name} and the fish body was because Singapore used to be a fishing village.  The Merlion Park actually has 2 Merlion structures, the original Merlion statue {8.6m} sprouting water into the Singapore River, and a cute baby Merlion cub {2m}. There's a few nice cafes around, and it's walking distance from other famous places of interest like the Padang, St Andrew's Cathedral and Raffles City. There's also a souvenir shop nearby but unless you want to be ripped off, I don't recommend you buying any omiyage from there. I had a look and a miniature wooden Merlion costs S$68!   It really was so packed over the weekend so if you do want to visit and get nice photographs, try to go over the weekdays. There's still space for kids to run around and have fun though.  There's actually 5 official Merlion statues in Singapore! One at Sentosa Island, two at Merlion Park, one more at Tourism Court {near Grange Road} and another at Mount Faber.

955,The historical face of Singapore,"Who doesn't recognize the image of the Merlion and associate it with the great city of Singapore?  We remember not too many years back when standing near the Merlion statue, you would be looking into a nice but empty Bay only able to see the reclaimed but undeveloped land known as Marina South. Just a few years later, the Merlion now faces the futuristic Marina Bay Sands Hotel (MBS), ArtScience Museum, Helix Bridge and the glowing Supertrees of the Gardens by the Bay just behind MBS. What a brave new world standing before the Merlion these days.   The Merlion is slowly losing its place as the face of Singapore as more people begin to associate the creative architectural developments like MBS with the city. This old symbol of the Singapore is now just one of many things to see in the Marina Bay area, representing its past while the rest of the city moves full steam ahead into the future.   We like the Merlion and are glad that it has maintained its foothold in the exciting new environment found around Marina Bay. It is a part of Singapore's past and heritage and is worth discovering for visitors of the city.   You can find the Merlion Statue just in front of the One Fullerton Heritage shopping and dining facility along the waterfront, facing the Marina Bay Sands.",en,2013-04-13,BradJill,"Hong Kong, China",125743,20502

There's no infrastructure or park or anything like that that would make this a destination.   Also, it was mobbed -- absolutely mobbed -- with people taking pictures and posing for pictures ...and all I wanted to do was get out of there as soon as possible.

Over the years, the Merlion has become the Iconic Symbol of Singapore and the current Merlion Park is a Photography Hot Spot for all visitors to Singapore as it features the Majestic Merlion set in the beautiful New Skyline of the Marina Bay area. Almost all visitors to Singapore would like to have a photograph taken with the Merlion in various posts for their album.   The Merlion is a very Photogenic Creature and it always turn up well in photographs, be it in the morning, afternoon or night depending on the preference of the individual.

965,You have to go there,"The Merlion is one of the top tourist attractions in Singapore. It is a huge statute of a half-lion, half-fish, that spouts tons of water out of its mouth constantly. It is slightly tacky but a must-see. The surrounding park is nice, and the best part is the view of the bay and marina and the overwhelming and futuristic Marina Bay Sands across the bay, which consists of three very tall buildings all the same height with a huge boat filled with trees on the top.

965,A (smaller than you imagine) icon of Singapore,"A visit to the Merlion, the icon of Singapore, needs to be included on the itinerary of any trip. It is busy around-the-clock, though early in the morning (about 8-ish onwards) the venue can be quite clogged with tour groups. If you go in the middle of the day, perhaps pop to the Asian Civilisation Museum afterwards to cool down, or take the Elizabeth Walk across the bay, rather than the bridge, where you will be very exposed to the sun.

We looked for the One Fullerton hotel knowing that the Merlion is just behind it.  Any first time visit to Singapore will not be complete without a photo with the great Merlion, and so we made sure we will not miss this place. We went here early in the morning. People already crowded the place doing different styles as they pose for the camera.  Me & my siblings were careful not make any naughty poses with the Merlion so as not to offend anybody knowing that it is sacred to the locals.

All the construction in the immediate vicinity has added an air of sophistication but I do slightly miss the old carefree waterfront that was so family-friendly. And because this is Singapore where food is never far from our thoughts, several restaurants now vie for one's attention.  The Merlion, being the symbol of Singapore (there's another one on Sentosa Island), takes centre stage and probably appears in a million photos.

There's some coffee shops and restaurants near the merlion for from food and drinks if you need them. From here you also get to see the Marina Bay Sands hotel/casino, Singapore Flyer, and Esplanade.   I strongly suggest going here at night. For one, it won't be as hot and humid as visiting it during the day. Second, the lights come out at night casting beautiful colored reflections on the water from the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and Esplanade.

981,We spent a great day here.,"Merlion “Park” as it’s referred to, is the focal point of the Marina Bay, and is a great place to start your exploration of the nice walks up and down the Singapore River to Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. If you tire of walking, you can always hop on a water taxi for part of the way. - Ladies, take a parasol for shade; they look nice on your pictures too!  Everyone takes pictures of the Merlion, the focal point of this area and the new symbol of Singapore, standing there on the edge of the bay, spouting a stream of water towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel & Casino on the other side. If only this mythical beast had the ability to raise an extended middle finger towards this three-legged monstrosity across the bay, then the symbolism would be complete!  Besides the mandatory shots of the Merlion, you must take pictures of the magnificent city-scapes of gleaming glass high-rise towers of the financial district rising behind the even more beautiful Fullerton Hotel This hotel is equally as fine on the inside as it is on the outside – but my experiences here are for another day.  For sure, Marina Bay is a tourist venue, but it is a nice place to spend time. I am a  “people watcher” and I take photographs, and there are subjects a-plenty here!

You will have to cross the multiple carriageway road from Fullerton hotel to get to the park.

Take my word, if you have a choice go for the night trip. The landscape @ night looks brilliant and you and even see the Merlion changing its colors. The Fullerton hotel which forms the background adds to the scenic views which you will surely capture in your cameras.

985,"A national icon, for all that is worth","It's strange, in somewhere as serious-minded and well organised as Singapore, that the official national icon is a fictitious half-lion, half-fish, perpetually belching water into Marina Bay.  But so it is, and arguably this is the mandatory photo opportunity for every visitor to Singapore. I don't buy that; it suggests the pinnacle of any visit to Singapore is a ferro-concrete statue, when there are so many other things: the zoo, the omnipresent hawker centres, the malls, the museums, that are all more Singaporean than this.  But nobody had to be rational when on holiday, did they?  The only other point against Merlion Park is that it's not so much a park (somewhere restful to pause, with gardens, recreational facilities, etc) as a paved area with a statue in the middle. There are various restaurants and bars close by; still, don't mistake it for something you absolutely have to do.

It was adopted as a symbol for Singapore when I was young and I am not sure why. I guess it is probably because they wanted a symbol or logo to represent Singapore's tourism.   The statue itself is nothing spectacular but it is iconic as it is a symbol chosen for and represent Singapore. You only need to spend 30 seconds taking a picture.  However since developments had started into the Marina South and bay sector, you can take a great stroll with great views around the Singapore city reservoir from the Marina promontory, Marina Bay Sands casino, Esplanade waterfront and Esplanade bridge. The view is particularly peaceful and pretty at night, not to mention much cooler.  Along the same route, you will find eateries, shopping outlets (both underground and above ground), river taxis, duck tours, world tallest ferris wheel and many much more.

It's a aesthetically, culturally and historically rich place. The Merlion is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, used as a mascot of Singapore. Its name combines ""mer"" meaning the sea and ""lion"". The fish body represents Singapore's history hundreds of years ago as a nondescript fishing village when it was known as Temasek (""sea town"" in Javanese), while the lion head represents Singapore's original name, Singapura, meaning ""lion city"", in local language. You can go there either by day or by night, and it'll be a lovely sight, especially with the city district in the background. For those who might be there in the evening, I suggest you go there just before 8.00pm or 9.30pm. That's when the sound and light show at Marina Bay Sands at the opposite bank starts.

One amusing reason to consider visiting the Merlion is to be photographed below it with the person being photographed seeming to hold onto the water spewing out of the Merlion's mouth! This is a popular tourist pastime at the Merlion Park. There are restaurants and more restaurants as elsewhere at Singapore, in close vicinity of the park and thus one can combine the visit to this attraction with a meal. Wild Lions have not been known in this region in recent centuries and thus any information on how the country took its name after a lion, at the Merlion Park would have helped.",en,2011-11-26,giribpai,"Mumbai, India",294,221

The lion had no fish tail whatsoever.  The park is located on the site of the sand bank Raffles supposedly stepped ashore. It's all covered by concrete now.

1003,Iconic Singapore attraction,"The Merlion is Singapore's icon so it is a must-go place for travellers who wish to take photos of their trip to this city state. IMHO the Merlion Park should not be a solo attraction in itself but as part of a cluster of attractions lining the Marina Bay promenade. On its own the Merlion Park can be 'done' in ten minutes. To make the trip to Merlion Park worthwhile, include other nearby attractions in an urban walking trail. Take the subway to Raffles Place MRT Station, walk towards 'Old Market' or 'Festival Market' or as the locals term it 'Lau Pasat' an alfresco food market which is immensely popular with the local office lunch crowd (avoid 12pm to 2pm lunch time peak), then head eastwards to the low rise Fullerton Bay Hotel to nurse a cold beer at its roof top bar, which boasts an excellent view of the surrounding skyscrapers plus Singapore's newest landmark, the Marina Bay Sands. Then head further east and you'll reach Merlion Park for your photo stop.  East of the Merlion Park is the Anderson Bridge which leads to the civic district where you'll find the statue of Singapore's founder Sir Stamford Raffles and Boat Quay if you use the pedestrian underpass. If you walk along the bayfront promenade, you'll notice the twin spiky structures resembling a pair of durians - the fragrant tropical fruit that one either likes or loathes - The Esplanade Theatres on The Bay, a very popular photo stop which is to Singapore what the Sydney Opera House is to Australia. Here is a good place to nurse another drink and tapas at Harry's Bar, South of the Esplanade Theatres, you'll be heading towards the Helix Bridge which leads to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark to round off your urban walking trail.",en,2011-09-14,Frappezz,Asia,2985,927
1003,One of Singapore's unique attraction,"The Merloin status is one of the attractions of Singapore and probably the main attraction that people think of when they think of singapore. Because we were staying at Mandarin Oriental, it was walk away although when we went there, we came from MBS so just took the taxi.   The Taxi dropped us off at a taxi rank which is next to resturants. You simply walk down the side to the statue and take photos of it and admire it. Theres the big statue and the small status behind it.   We took photos and then once we took enough photos, we continued to our next destination and waited for our taxi.

It's situated at the mouth of the Singapore river and in a nice area with shops and restaurants within easy reach.

On Sentosa there is a further Merlion attraction. A lift takes you to the top of the statue to an observation deck with views out over port area of Singapore and the island itself. While the Merlion on Sentosa predates the Skytower and is lower, it has the advantage of allowing you to take your own time to view the sights.",en,2007-09-22,myrm,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",13079,119
1009,Nice Views,"The observation deck on top gives nice views of the city and the port. OK the little history film they show is hokey, and the exhibit on sea monsters is just silly, and they keep playing an annoying song, but what counts is the views, and on a nice day it is worth it. You can stay up as long as you want (and as a fan of observation decks I stay quite a while) which is why I choose this over the sky tower - it is up for a few minutes and then goes down.",en,2005-05-01,Global18970,,35,392

143,"The Merlion Park - Face of Lion, Body of a Fish!","Who has not seen this iconic place, whether in person or in media, the world famous and most recognisable and prominent face of Singapore, known as its mascot - The Merlion – a large sculpted statue with a lion’s face and with a body of a fish – spouting a long jet-stream of water from its mouth.   The place is known as The Merlion Park and is quite popular among the visitors; in fact, visit to Singapore is incomplete without posing for a picture with the Merlion in the background. Tourist throng to this park and get themselves clicked, especially in trick poses, from the viewing deck in front of the statue – it appears in the picture as if the spouted water is falling straight into one’s open mouth.   We too had clicked many such happy pictures, tricked ones and otherwise, with Merlion, and also with three-towered Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the cityscape in the background.

Next to the bay is the perfect place for this beauty. But there is a problem. Singapore is always hot and as such you will not be able to enjoy the view unless you time it well. I suggest evening boat ride. Yellow light from the sun is perfect. The breeze will keep you cool. The boat ride will show you all the major attractions from the bay.

It is also comfortable in the evening when you are walking along the bay and enjoy the cool breeze. There are some performances and entertainments in bleachers as well.

545,Quick Tour,"Singapore, it was a small country but really disciplined And that's really amazing!! My sister and I took a tour package from the airport for like $85 each, (it comes with the city tour, boat ride and the Singapore zoo entrance ticket as well, and a train card each) not knowing that its a walking tour, I was just shocked,coz we're a bit tired of walking, coming from our place to go anywhere, bus here, and ride a train then transfer to another and another train again (and I've never try to have a walking tour :) ) And every place we go, the tour guide will just give us 10 mins to take picture and then move to another destination! So yeah, 10 minutes won't be enough for you not just to take pictures but to appreciate and roam around a bit on that certain place. and the thing is, its hard to find room to have a picture in front of the Merlion! it took us around 5 mins to get a good spot! ''long queue'' seriously! :) and there was an old man (his Chinese) while my sister is taking my photo he just get near of me and touch my arm and tell me to move! because he wants to take lots of photos again! (knowing we waited for them to finished first) and my camera is a Polaroid what a waste of film!, he did it like thrice :) but we just ignored him and then leave! We need to hurry coz we we're the only missing from our group and proceed to the boat ride! and that's he best part of the tour!  The Tour Guide is really nice tho,   But yeah, I suggest if you'll come to SG just search where you wanna go! Coz as I said, its a small country so, and all the train stations are connected and usually downstairs there'll be a bus station, you just need to check the number, coz each number travels different ways, and yeah, before I forget better visit SG on 2020 coz when we went there last June (2016) and there are a lot of road works there, and he said that those road workers are planned to be tunnels, for train, coz the gov't. wants to make a train that would bring their people home in just 7 mins, in other words they'll have train station near their houses. Amazing aye?! Hope we can go there again! So we can see the difference 😊  All in all, it was really nice experience, but I think, its kinda pricey there, but my sister and I are good with budgeting our money, so yeah, we usually eat in the food stands in train station to save money! For just like $2.5-$4 each we got rice and dish already its yummy and healthy! and we're full! Rather than eating in fast foods and restos which is way expensive! Coz we once ate in burger king and we spent $25. 😊😊",en,2016-07-26,raianna0792,,13,10

This is the usual line I hear from other people, or read from magazines whenever Singapore will be brought into topic.

Of course, you have to visit this place when you go to Singapore since this is one of your tour/trip's highlight. No entrance fee required. Wear a cap/hat/bandana, sunglass, and put sunblock lotion since Mr. Sunshine or Mr. Rain will unexpectedly say hello once in a while. You're lucky if it is cloudy since it will be good for a perfect photo (base on my opinion).

Everything is just sooo great! When you visit Singapore, make sure to drop by at the Merlion! It's just great! ;) Singapore is ♥",en,2015-01-24,betty_johnny23,,21,10
855,A grand view of the waterfront,I visited the park at day time and during a balmy evening. Situated in a location that has postcard view of the waterfront snd close to other tourist attractions. There are lovely restaurants and cafes too. Great place for photo opportunities.,en,2015-01-23,JeffreyC291,"Sydney, Australia",509,253
855,Iconic,Any Singapore trip has to have a trip to this monument of this country. Best times to go would be from 9-11 am and from 7.00-9.00pm to see how sunlight and the night lighting casts a different aura on the attraction. Lots of people are here so strategize how to get the best spots quickly.,en,2015-01-23,Nsm0410,,30,55
855,pls dont prioritize this .,"Really this place had been hyped up by travellers . its like the eifffel tower or Pisa photo situation . YOU MUST HAVE ONE WITH THE merlion . do not even bother if u missed it . we keprt it last on our trip and visited it on our final day walk in Singapore . its a small square and your be shocked at the no of people there . Boat quay or Clarke quay is so much better scenic wise and rewarding . you decide , we went to see it so I guess now I know .",en,2015-01-23,Earth_Shuttle,"Goa, India",35,12
892,Singapore's pet ...,Going to Singapore and not having visited the Merlion near Fullerton One would be a mistake. We spent some time walking around along the place - there are a few restaurants and places one can get a snack or a full meal.   Access over the Bridge from the Esplanade or walking along the Boat Quay from Raffles Place. Like many other places easy Access by using (S)MRT.,en,2014-08-24,Bariloche-61,Zurich,1876,217
892,"Not a park, Be warned before getting disappointed ","It's iconic and every tourist goes there, so you are obliged to go there . But here is the reality check:- It's just a medium sized statue with water coming out of a pipe within the lions mouth. There isn't much to do apart from taking photograph amidst the crowd. Go here in the evening to tick the place in your list of places to visit.",en,2014-08-24,AvinashsVerdict,"Bengaluru, India",14,14
892,you shouldnt miss it if you're in sg,we went there in the morning so the sun was up high but you wont mind the the scorching heat of the sun when you feel excited to take a picture with the Merlion at your back :) its a must-see for tourists and a must picture to have when you are in this side of the world so there would be so many tourists hanging around this area. (tip: sunscreens/sunblock is a musthave for a singapore trip; hats/umbrellas/fans too!) if you want decent pictures one must bring a monopod/selfiepod so that your pictures would look ok eventhough there would be like many hands/shoulders/elbows/flaglets/hats etc. (i was there early summer 2014) there are restaurants in the area as well as a souvenirs shop so there area is definitely an all-in for tourists how to get there?!? researching online and the use of maps and signs is easy to go to this famous SG landmark! additional tip: look at how pictures were taken. on what side? the backdrop? you can take it with the MarinaSands like the thumbnail above ♡,en,2014-08-24,myschkinf2018,"Cagayan de Oro, Philippines",205,45
892,Iconic,Visited last August. The Singa-pore Merlion is an iconic must see when you are in Singapore. Having seen it from the water it was so nice to wander around the park and see it.

90,Overrated ,"So it’s just a statue of a half lion - half mermaid and is ALWAYS full of tourists trying to take that icon shot. There’s really not much to see around it, and the one time it actually looks good is at night but then that picture you always wanted cannot be taken then. Honestly the statue isn’t even of a big size or anything. Just take a look if you really want to else skip it coz it ain’t that much 😔",en,2018-12-30,vidhatavm2018,"Suva, Fiji",22,10

There is also a bigger version on Sentosa island just by Singapore.",en,2018-12-27,nutsandyoda,"Redhill, United Kingdom",27,39
92,Crowded but the magic still works !,"This is the first time my kids visited this park as we don’t really like huge crowd. The view from this park which just across MBS is breath taking, especially so that we were there sunset time. We love the milkshakes and sliders offered by restaurants around the area. Mind you , a bit pricey . For three milkshakes, 2 french fries and 4 tiny sliders we paid Sgd 76. Well sitting there watching the view and feeling so at Peace is worth more than 76Sgd . ❤️😘❤️",en,2018-12-26,Flormir,"Makati, Philippines",1185,68

95,Iconic place,This is undoubtedly the only place one can recognize while speaking about singapore. The locations is easily accessible through public transport. Was a 10 min cab drive from the place I was staying in Katong. Being the tourist place it is mostly crowded but worth a visit. Try visiting during dawn or evening hours to experience both sunset/sunrise & night lights. Has a good view of Marina bay & singpore flyer. A couple of hawker centers nearby makes it economical to grab a quick bite as the onboard restaurants can be a bit pricey. But a great place to spend the evening enjoying the breeze & admiring the beauty.,en,2018-12-11,vishalj758,"Mumbai, India",35,21
