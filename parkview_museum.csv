1,Horrible experience,"I had a nasty experience at the parkview museum and a very unpleasant encounter with the security guard. I must admit that i had finger tip touched chair exhibition as I was fascinated with the type of material was used to stack the whole artpiece together. After which, He laser pointed at me for over a minute without speaking a word and proceeded to argue with me when I questioned was it because you cannot touch the exhibit? Honestly, if he had just told me that I cannot touch the artpiece, (in this case, I merely index finger tip point it, you can check the camera footage for my 1 second pleasure) I would have apologised immediately. I have been to many museums. If the exhibition cannot be touched, like in the national gallery, there is tape around the floor of the exhibit piece to make it clear of the boundaries. He told me if I was unhappy, I can leave the place then followed me around. That same day, I just came from the national design centre where “Prototype in Tokyo” is now on exhibition at level 1. It followed the same principle. There are touchables and untouchables in this exhibition had proper barriers like I mentioned as well as SAC which I visited the same day. He is simply the rudest and the most punk like security I have encountered in all museum visiting. Horrible experience, not worth the trouble.",en,2020-01-21,Tricialee1010,Singapore,7,2
1,Amazing,"The building itself is amazing, but the exhibition at the museum during our visit, Disturbing narratives, was just as good. Well worth a detour if you are interested in contemporary art.",en,2019-10-23,jonnad846,"Uppsala, Sweden",36,8
1,Breezing Willow,The museum is situated on the third floor of the Parkview Square. Currently collection of the ancient new year printing from the National Art Museum of China was exhibited in the museum. Interesting.,en,2019-03-08,503sergiym,"Dublin, Ireland",1563,107
1,Breath taking interior ,"The Art Deco building is very impressive from the outside but inside it’s just WOW,it’s like stepping back to the 1920,it’s just beautiful.your allowed to take photos and the opportunities for great shots are endless.In the outside area around the building there are some interesting modern sculptures too.",en,2019-01-28,nadia089,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",532,121
1,Underrated oasis,Really enjoyed the museum exhibition (Intriguing Uncertainties). We stumbled upon the building by chance in Bugis. Loved the design of the building (reminiscent of the great gatsby). The environment was so peaceful as well! The exhibition itself was free (not open on sunday). There was not many people so it was easy to relax and take your time to enjoy the artworks. Highly recommend!,en,2018-12-27,otonashii,"Melbourne, Australia",125,30
2,Great Gallery tucked away in the 2nd floor,An interesting building that looks like it has come from NYC. Has quality artwork around it and the place has amazing detail architecturally. The gallery is quite a large space on the second floor. No cost. The artwork is interesting particularly if you are interested in visual art. The bar downstairs looked really nice.,en,2018-11-07,lucya398,"Canberra, Australia",53,10
2,First visit,I’ve been curious about this museum for some time and finally was able to visit it this week during lunch. There was an exhibition of contemporary Italian art. Free to enter and quite interesting to see.,en,2018-04-27,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383
2,The current exhibition is...,"a knockout.   It is a shame that so few locals will see it. Or maybe not, as the only locals I saw were leaning on the statues taking selfies, and tapping on the glass of the frames.   From the 6 Dali works in the foyer of Atlas and Parkview Square, through the opulent bar, up to level 3, this is a real treat.  It is rare to see such wonderful art for free - indeed, this is the private collection if a Mr Wong. And Mr Wong has an eye for modern Italian art.   Much better and actually more classy than ""doing"" high tea downstairs.",en,2018-04-12,shinraemonsam,"Sydney, Australia",1078,229
2,Parkview square has interesting scuptures and artwork,"We were just walking towards Bugis MRT when we came across Parkview square which had some interesting sculptures and artwork out the front of Parkview hotel. We decided to go inside to view the current exhibition of young Italian artists which was fairly uninteresting and boring. If you go, check out the bar/ dinning area of the Parkview hotel (very close to where the museum is located) which has a classical Egyptian theme.",en,2018-04-10,danielvJ7722IT,"Darwin, Australia",153,36
2,If you are an art lover then you should visit The Parkview Museum.,"I happened upon The Parkview Museum when I was walking along North Bridge Road in the direction of Kampong Glam. My attention was attracted by the magnificent building and the statues in Parkview Square and then I saw the sign on the pavement for The Parkview Museum's ""Challenging Beauty - Insights into Italian Contemporary Art"" exhibition that is running at the museum from 17th March 2018. It is a Free to enter museum and the collection of art was of interest to me, although some of it was not my taste and to be honest I do wonder how some artists manage to get away with something that to me is something that a kindergarten kid could do in an art session! But hey that is art, some you like some you just don't get!! Anyway if you like your art then this museum is certainly worth a visit. Located on the 3rd Floor of the stunning Parkview Building and open Noon-7pm Mondays to Saturdays.",en,2018-03-23,Roberts69,"Northampton, United Kingdom",13282,1241
3,"Free, and super interesting!","The museum is a bit odd to find - you just go up to the third floor. It only has one exhibition on at a time, so the content and the quality of the same is variable, but I really enjoyed the exhibition on when I visited. It’s free, to boot.   Worth a visit for sure!",en,2018-02-15,CraigM88,"London, United Kingdom",168,23
3,Interesting!,"Chanced on here and checked out the art exhibition ""The Artists Voice"". Exhibition was depressing and of no value (sorry) but the building is spectacular. The building is Art Deco style with some pretty fancy interior decoration. Nice!",en,2018-01-03,Nunngo,ACT,1601,391
3,Private museum,"Read about this private museum and dropped by. Small and focusing on contemporary art, it has installations in addition to paintings. Apart from gilbert & george, i don't recognise the other artists",en,2017-12-15,bcheong,"Bangkok, Thailand",23103,1470
3,Finding a good place for free,"Been tasked to source for an outing for staff and happened to chance this interesting exhibition on sharks and humanity.   There's free guided tour approx 30mins provided on certain weekdays session.   It showcase interesting exhibits by various artists from local, china etc.  We will learn to reflect and help save the environment! Pls do your tiny part and it will be appreciated by the world.  Cheers",en,2017-07-10,tagohHS,"Singapore, Singapore",727,87
3,Interesting building ,"I would have given 3.5 stars if I could. I visited the current exhibition ""on sharks and humanity"" which is free to all. The building itself is a rarity in Singapore with its odd Gothic art Deco influenced architecture and huge statues all combined in a standalone site. The interior is beautiful and the lobby houses an old style glam cafe. The museum proper is on the third floor of the building and an even odder surprise awaits intrepid visitors: Toto heated bidet toilets!  The exhibition is peculiarly relevant as it's an art exhibition spearheaded by shark protection activists, ocean activists in collaboration with prominent Chinese , with art works by Chinese and local artists. Peculiar as the Chinese are known to prize sharks' fin as a rare delicacy, so it's even more stark to see that pockets of Chinese resistance and awareness to shark protection are present.  I like the sculptural artworks very much. Their magnificent beauty should please the Instagram selfie visitors. I wish the mesmerising dreamy short film by Royston Tan starring Pamelyn Chee could be made into a full feature film.   Great visit overall.",en,2017-06-25,SimoneSMC,,77,18
4,Incredible architecture,"We weren't looking for this building but we passed it and couldn't help but stop. It is incredible to see. It felt like it came out of a different universe and it was reminiscent of an Ayn Rand novel - maybe the Atlas statue in the front helped!  Worth a visit and a drink, they are strong but mixed so smoothly you won't know until it is too late. :)",en,2017-05-06,87geel,,24,10
4,Lovely building and cool little museum - Has the fancy toilets also,Had a lovely wander around the grounds of this museum/hotel and the display of 'On Sharks and Humanity'.  The museum is quite small and the display was very short but interesting.  Good to spend maybe 30mins to an hour in if you are in the bugis area. There are many things around this location to waste an afternoon.,en,2017-04-19,daryls640,London,512,181
4,shark fin blues,"The current exhibition at Parkview Museum, titled 'Sharks and Humanity', could be called 'Sharks and Inhumanity' given the decimation of that species in recent years (it's reckoned that 70 million are killed on an annual basis). Let's be clear - I am not objective on the subject of shark finning. I'm a diver and far prefer to see these magnificent creatures under the water than ending up in someone's soup bowl, so it's great to find an exhibition that attempts to dissuade people from the latter practice through art as well as documentary and photographic evidence. Access is via the ground floor of the splendid 'Gotham City' building (which is worth a gawp in itself) where you need to sign in before going to level three. There's no charge. The core of the exhibition has already been shown in Monaco and Beijing before coming to Singapore. In each location local artists are invited to contribute some works. The end product is rather varied in quality but there are a few striking pieces besides the informational content which is very light touch though the shots of dead sharks and finning on one wall are shocking. To be honest, it's not a fantastic exhibition by any stretch of the imagination but I applaud the intent and the desperate need for action.",en,2017-03-31,adrianloader,"London, United Kingdom",544,198
