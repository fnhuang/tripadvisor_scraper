1,Great for Malay clothing,This complex will only appeal if you are looking for Malay clothing or tailored modest dresses. The quality is fantastic and the stores are generally quiet.,en,4/20/2019,U5137YYamyc,"Melbourne, Australia",125,42
1,Malay lifestyle mall,"In Singapore’s multi ethnic/racial society, this is the Malay’s equivalent of Chinatown. Its not purely a tourism attraction but it gives an insight into the Malays in Singapore for those who want to know more about Malays in general. Halal food is easy to find here. Fabrics, fashion, carpets, perfumeries, jewelry shops and various items that matter to the Malay household. Malays from various corners of Singapore have for years been coming to Geylang Serai market opposite the mall. The mall and environs are pretty much the same whole year round. But the ultimate best time to visit is during the Muslim Ramadhan or fasting month. You wont be disappointed by the sights and offerings here.",en,10/30/2017,Datokadir,"Singapore, Singapore",81,38
1,Not to be recommended for tourists,"This was recommended by our taxi driver on the way from airport, and as it was in the same street as our hotel, we gave it a try. The less said the better as it had little of any interest to us. It was conveniently close to a good range of street food in the next street along Geylang Rd toward the city.",en,11/7/2016,Jan_n_Glenn,Australia,186,103

2,"Fabrics, clothing,  not much more. ","Inevitably, we will come to this place to visit, and end up buying something we didn't need, but were lured by the gorgeous array of fabrics, patterns and colours. Not a huge place, but with more than a few locals to make you feel part of this fantastic community.",en,4/22/2016,Y1223XBlucyb,"Bristol, United Kingdom",178,77

2,Not Your Typical Mall,A shopping complex catering to local Malays selling cheap fabrics to decorate homes. An old shopping complex just opposite the infamous Geylang Serai Market.
