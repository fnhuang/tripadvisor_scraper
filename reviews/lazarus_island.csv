1,New Favourite Spot,"The small beach is still littered with litter by the shorelines. But it is still a nice quiet place to relax and be away from the crowd.  Be warned, there are no amenities on this island, so do pack what you think you may need.",en,2019-09-04,Brendaishungry,,11,1
1,A short getaway ,"Lazarus island as connected by a bridge to st john island. Easily reach within 20min from Singapore via ferry. Great getaway for a daytrip or picnic if want to avoid the crowd at other Singapore beaches. We chanced upon a family of otters. The fat cats on the island has beautiful fur. Though some people comment lots of mozzies but I get none, perhaps is the dry season. Too hot until the coconut trees became bald, no bugs want to come out under the blazing sun. With the sea breeze, is rather comfy under the wooden shelters.",en,2019-09-03,182chenf,,32,1
1,Relaxation on an Island Away from the City,A quiet and serene place for relaxation. Good view of the sea and nearby island. Able to enjoy the breeze in a very quiet surrounding. Good to have picnic at the island.,en,2019-08-07,PBL1956,"Singapore, Singapore",4,1
1,"Start early, quiet place for tanning","Reached Marina South Pier MRT at 9.30am. Exit B to the pier. You can see the pier once you are out of the MRT. It's not necessary for you to purchase your ferry tickets online. You can purchase it on the spot. You don't need passport to head over to Lazarus island. It's still part of Singapore. $18 per ticket, includes the return ride back. Remember to have sufficient cash, I didn't see any cashless mode of payment neither was there an ATM.  You can purchase food and drinks at the pier. There's quite a few of shops selling similar things. Like a 1.5l bottle of 100plus cost $3 and 1.5l mineral water was $1, banana was at 50cents to 60cents per unit.  There's no shops on St John island and Lazarus island. Lazarus island is connected to St John island. Maybe a 15-20mins walk. No trash bin at Lazarus, but you can throw your trash at St John island.  Toilets with showering facilities are available at both Lazarus and St John island. There's no hooks behind the doors of the bathing cubicles, so you cannot hang your clothes behind the door.  Started my journey to St John Island at 10am. The ride is around 20-30mins to St John and by the time I walked to Lazarus island it was around 11am including the time to find a spot to settle down.",en,2019-08-02,JamieSG27,"Singapore, Singapore",29,10
1,Weekend getaway to southern island Lazarus!,"Clearest blue sea which is part of Singapore southern islands,recommend to go there for picnic with friends,family or as couplet.ferry from Maria south Pier takes about 30 mins and cost about 15 sgd only. I had a fun and nice experience with friends.it worth it and will definitely go there again.",en,2019-05-01,khinnandarm,,91,3
2,Stopover at Lazarus Island,"I rented a yacht for a family and friends outing and it sailed to Lazarus Island for a stopover for 3 hours. Even on a weekend, it wasn't crowded. There were a few guys who had set up a camp there to do fishing. It has a sandy beach and it was very windy so we were able to fly kites easily. Not much facilities though. It is good to get there if you like a quiet place to go to the beach. There were a few yachts/catamarans docked at the island so seemed quite a number of people who visited went by that transportation on the day I visited",en,2019-03-28,ZN201890,,30,0
2,beautiful beach with limited facility,"1. took a boat ride that cost SGD18/return. the rides are readily available at Marina South Pier.The ride approximately take moreabout 20minutes in good weather to St.John Island Jetty.  2. This island is connected by a bridge with St. John Island, take a good long walk in between this two island for a good instagrammable picturettes.   3.No food outlets currently available, and part of the beach in St.John Island is closed due to environmental pollution.Nevertheless, this beautiful white beach island is open for visitation",en,2018-12-08,tiqaa,"Kajang, Malaysia",217,45
2,Great island escape for a day,"Really enjoyed my time here! Well worth renting a boat for a little fishing and paddle boarding around the area. There are otters, monitors, eagles and plenty of interesting other wildlife, including a turtle sanctuary nearby. Amazing this little bit of peace and quite is so close to a major CBD area. Greenwood fish market is in the marina area in Sentosa, highly recommend getting a seafood platter from there and taking out on your trip with a few bottles of wine.",en,2018-11-12,fozbob,"Shanghai, China",112,18
2,Quaint and quiet island for running and relaxing,"I love that our leashed dog and I was able to do plenty of running around the island's perimeter thanks to its concrete paths. The beach side was nice and quiet without any crowds, perfect for swimming apart from some dirty rubbish-laden stretches. The other side of the island also offers a lovely view of the downtown Singapore skyline. It does get extremely hot in the day here so be prepared for the lack of shade. Do also bring your own refreshments as there are none on the island.",en,2018-10-07,57ashleyl,"Singapore, Singapore",292,57
2,Beautiful Hideaway,"We took a trip here after reading about it online and weren’t disappointed. It’s so easy to get to, just walk out of South Pier MRT, straight ahead to the ticket booth and board the boat. Once you get to St John’s island just walk across the causeway to the beach. It’s so peaceful and it feels like you’re on another holiday, not 20 minutes from Singapore.  When we were there they were doing lots of work on St John’s and Kusu so you need to bring your own food and drink. I also wish I’d brought mosquito repellent, I left covered in bites. If you can manage it I’d also suggest bringing a beach umbrella or similar as the only shady places to sit are a little set back from the beach.",en,2018-08-28,Alpaca_Explorer,,74,23
3,Lazarus island review,Beautiful beach. Ideal for everyone. Swimming is allowed. Toilets and showers free of cost. No restaurants on the island. Take the Singapore island cruise ferry from the Marina South pier MRT station. Best to visit during the day on a non rainy day.,en,2018-06-12,JanhaviB11,"Mumbai, India",249,15
3,"History, walking and swimming / picnicking","This is a very easy trip to make. Hop of the MRT at Marina South Pier, exit and walk diagonally forward and to the left. You'll see the little orange booking office; 1 minute walk away. Return tickets are $18, no discounts except for children. There are toilets immediately to the left of the booking office. There are more trips scheduled on Saturday and Sunday, & no crowds, so I'd suggest a trip on the weekend. Lazarus was variously used by the British, Japanese, as a quarantine station, a Police Post, an Army barracks, a marine research centre, a rehab centre, a leperosium and a teens' adventure camp. If you have an inquiring mind, you'll find lots of vestiges of previous occupants of the island if you walk around the interior. There's a causeway connecting St John's to Lazarus, which is worth visiting. There's a very sheltered swimming area in the curve of the causeway. There are toilets up the hill on the right of the ferry pier as you disembark. Remember to bring: water bottles, sun block cream, hat, bathers, food / snack. Be sure to budget your time so you can visit Kusu Island as well. It's the second stop on your ferry trip.",en,2018-06-05,jeanettem190,"Cairns, Australia",473,181
3,Works on St John and Lazarus island,I visited last weekend and the ferry ticket guy said not to go to kusu island as they are working there and on St John's. St John's is almost conpletely closed off but they're also working on lazarus island. The beach can still be reached though and the small trails can also be used. There was no sign of works on kusu island (yet?) as I noticed when the return ferry moored there.,en,2018-06-04,geertb2017,"Sao Paulo, SP",178,15
3,Who knew? Not Singaporeans.,"Barely met a Singaporean who knows about Saint John's and Lazarus - oh, you mean Sentosa? No. I don't.  I mean taking the $18 ferry 6.5km from Marina South Pier for 20 minutes to Saint John's Island, then taking the first left off the jetty. Follow the path across the breakwall/causeway, past the little protected bay on your left and a few minutes on you will come to the reason for your journey: a clean, white sand beach lined with coconut palms. Chope your business under one of these trees - not directly below the coconuts though - as there is little else in the way of shade.   This beach is a real revelation. No waves is a real bummer, but I guess that makes it better for all the expat families and migrant workers who frequent Lazarus. For real, you will see barely a Singaporean who isn't part of some Brompton club. Which means you won't see any inflatable unicorns either. Maybe too hot, or too sunny. My advice - wear a hat, long sleeves, sunscreen.  Crucial: don't forget your sunscreen. And a picnic. And some ice-cold brews.  Nothing else to mention about Lazarus. Go explore - it's a decent size - but don't expect anything better than that sweet little stretch of sand.",en,2018-04-01,shinraemonsam,"Sydney, Australia",1078,229
3,Great island,"Wonderful beach, beautiful scenery! Great to spend a day with the family. Alight on St John and walk around the island itself and also to explore the various connected islands. Lazarus is on the left of the pier. Ferry costs $18 (adult price) for round trip, you can hop to Kusu before you head back to mainland. Just take note of the ferry departure time. No food is sold here, so it is best to pack food (no pork or lard if you are going to Kusu as well) for picnic. It is a good idea to pack your own drinks too. Not a lot of shelter area , so do take weather forecast into consideration before going. Last of all, put on sunblock. My friend and I had sunburns.",en,2018-02-07,LiliumD1,,7,5
4,pleasantly surprised!,"went to the Southern Islands for the first time because we felt like spending a day at the beach. Chose Lazarus since many have said it's the best beach you can find in Singapore.   My expectations still wasnt that of any beach holiday destination around the region, but I have to say, the beach and waters and Lazarus is as good as it gets in Singapore.   Just have to make sure you go prepared with food and water. Nearest shower facility should be the one at St John, but even that isnt anything much.",en,2018-02-07,Aziz_Azhar,"Singapore, Singapore",2,1
4,Fun day out,"Really nice beaches, not too crowded Ferry costs $18 for a return trip Go early in the morning and make the best of the weather before the afternoon clouds, not much shelter if it rains No real place to buy food there either so stock up before going!",en,2017-08-25,I5625YDjackm,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",23,11
4,Place to escape the crowds ,"We came here on a Tuesday, being a group of three adults and two children under 10. Took the 10am ferry from Marina Bay Pier ($18 return adult/$12 child) approx 30 min pleasant ride to St Johns Island. Upon exiting the ferry turn left once you walk down the pier, then it's a 20min walk (probably faster without kids) walk across the rock wall to Lazarus Island. There is a small beach as soon as you get to the island or you can walk a bit further and reach a much larger beach on the other side of the island. The beach is quite long and pleasant. Perhaps I've been spoilt from other beaches visited in other countries as I didn't think the beach was that good. I can understand if you want to escape the Sentosa Island crowds it's a good and easy option. It's pretty safe for weak swimmers as it slopes gradually and no current in the 'lagoon'. Take your own food/water as there is none to buy on St Johns or Lazarus. There is toilets/change room/shower facilities on St Johns but not Lazarus. There is a couple of large shelters with benches on Lazarus to put your bags etc, just beware the ants! All our bags were covered in ants after only half an hour, even the ones without food inside. Take some insect repellent for the mosquitoes and sunscreen of course. The ferry stops at Kusu Island on the way home, after spending less than an hour on Kusu I'd have preferred to spend the day there rather than Lazarus as it's much nicer, but doesn't have that remote feeling, if that's what you're after.",en,2017-08-08,ksrocket,"Melbourne, Australia",68,21
4,Worth the effort,"Came here some time back with the family. It's not particularly easy to get to, with the only practical option being to take the scheduled ferry to St John's island and then walk across (unless you hire a private boat). The beach here is probably the best in Singapore, but be careful of the sand flies as they can leave some nasty scars!",en,2017-06-26,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383
4,SG's Best Beach,"My husband and I thought of enjoying the beach last weekend. We decided to take a ferry from Marina South Pier to St John's Island. It was $18 round trip for an adult. The 20min ferry ride was comfortable. After getting off the ferry, we strolled along St John. Here you get to access St John, Lazarus and Kusu Island. Toilets and shower rooms are located here. Then we walked farther for 20mins and finally saw the white beach of Lazarus! I didnt set my expectations too high, but I really was amazed that I was still in Singapore but found naturally fine, white sand. We found our own spot, Then we rolled our mats under the huge tree and started our picnic. I enjoyed the fresh breeze and sound of the waves. It was very relaxing. And of course, swam and played at the beach. Lots of other tourists had rented yachts though they dont really go ashore. The place aint too crowded. Really just perfect to unwind. Make sure to bring along enough food and drinks as there are no stores in the island.   Highly recommended place for beaching!! For family, friends or couples...",en,2017-06-11,JangLagua,"Singapore, Singapore",50,6
5,nice beach for a short getaway from the city,"this is part of the southern islands of singapore which is a good short getaway from the city life of singapore. theres not a lot of amenities here so you have to bring your own food. you can go there via ferry( $18 for round trip ticket and has timing for weekdays and weekends so pls check the website for singapore southern islands) or some groups rent a yatch to enjoy this secluded area with frends. there are toilets and some wash area you can use after taking a dip on the beach. you can have picnic here, relax and enjoy the beauty of nature and the beach:)",en,2017-05-13,TobyV568,,60,7
