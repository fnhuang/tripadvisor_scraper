1,Didn't know that the place has closed,"didnt know about this place, and didnt know that its already closed. Met the owner when i was walking along the streets near the mosque, he invited me over to take pictures of the two museums (theres another museum next door). Both very small with second storeys. I was quite taken aback becos theres many physical contacts when asking me to pose and helping me to adjust my clothes. Of course he did not touch me inappropriately. however i take it as he was being super friendly and enthusiastic, he helped me to take alot of pics using my phone. Anyway if he had something up to his sleeves I could have just report him to the police since the museums cant run away lol. He showed me alot of pictures and postcards sent by his visitors to thank him. He also said that he's a photographer. More on the museum, i think there's nothing much, but worth for some quick photo taking! Very nice backgrounds. you can even ask to wear the traditional peranakan costume.",en,2019-11-12,ronggx,,1,1
1,Hidden gem,"We randomly walked around after finding the mural near aliwal art centre. The owner greeted us enthusiastically and asked us to come in for more phototaking. So we did. He was very enthusiastic and asking us to take photo and suggested us to pose in different ways. He helped us to take photos. Sometimes a bit too enthusiastic. We were taken back a bit as normally there wouldnt be much physical contact if you see the people for the first time. However we interpret it as he was simply very enthusiastic in showing us what this place has to offer. He also showed us a lot of postcards and photos that some of the previous visitors had sent him after their visits. After seeing the ground floor of his shop he offered us to see the second floor of the cafe next door. It turns out that there were more of his toys collections and if i was older i bet it must bring back heaps of childhood memories. Anyways, he was a bit too enthusiastic and our phone's battery was always used up from phototaking. So we thanked the owner and said bye. We promised to write a review and here we go.  A hidden gem i must say.  If you do not mind talking to a super enthusiastic and maybe will have a bit of physical contact when posing,then this place a worth a quick stop by.",en,2019-06-01,misschuic,,9,1
1,Down Memory Lane,"It was quite nice to see the toys, books, things of our childhood days. Brought back many pleasant memories. Though it is a small place but it's crammed full of things. Admission is free. Do drop by for a visit to experience Singapore's past.",en,2017-03-29,PakSoonL,"Singapore, null, Singapore",786,103
1,Quaint little place,"I was in the area during my short venture around Kampong Glam and saw this place. I won't say that I'm old enough to actually experience all the classic games and toys of Singapore, but the signage outside drew me in. Initially, the owner invited to us to take a look at the main gallery upstairs for S$2. It was a good deal, so we went in, and there were already a few kids there with their parents. The kids were really enjoying themselves with the toys, which was really warming to see. The area was really small, mostly unmaintained, but otherwise presents almost everything you want to see about what kids did in the past. The owner's demeanor changed a lot when we were leaving, giving a curt nod when we left. He was also muttering angrily about the kids upstairs playing with the bell too much.",en,2016-06-12,Edward_LSL,"Singapore, Singapore",195,27
1,Really rude owner,"I was there with a couple of friends checking out some of the nostalgic games on display and I was seriously considering purchasing some of the toys on display outside.  The owner, I have to say, is really two-faced. He would offer to take photos for tourists who were outside the shop (but not checking out the store), in hopes of luring them into the museum. But when my friend asked nicely to take a photo for us, he rudely turned us down and walked away, saying he's not free. As I have seen in previous reviews, the owner is not a nice person, he only cares about his business. It's true he does have some really neat toys in the store. But his ugly personality is honestly rather repulsive (how can someone so awful be the face of a little children museum?)",en,2015-12-30,heny93,"Melbourne, Australia",8,4
2,Childhood Nostalgia,"While exploring Kampong Glam on our Singapore holiday, my wife and I wandered into this place on Friday 6th November 2015. The owner promptly collected $2 from each of us, gave us each a ticket and directed us upstairs to the museum. We asked him if it was okay for us to take photographs of the exhibits and he replied in the affirmative.   As we walked up the creaky staircase we were confronted by a plethora of toys, and other childhood memorabilia. There were old school books and school items from the 1960s, a barberâ€™s chair, an old drinks stall, a motor scooter, to name a few of the items on display. Not to mention, there were toys and dolls galore. There was a lot to behold in every nook and cranny, much to our delight.  On our way out we tried to engage the owner in a conversation, but he seemed pre-occupied with folding a sheet of brown paper and appeared uncommunicative. We thanked him and left.",en,2015-11-30,pragasam,"Brisbane, Australia",1164,126
2,This Museum Provides A View of the Toys that Singapore Children in the 60s-70s Used to Enjoy,"I'm in my 40s, so I can relate to this place because it features a collection of toys that date back in the 60s-70s, and it brought back many memories of what one's childhood in Singapore used to be like. I must acknowledge that the collection here is not an exhaustive one, but for the very low admission fee ($2?), I think it is worth dropping by this place while visiting the area. A visit to this museum shouldn't take more than an hour, unless you wish to examine every exhibit quite intensely.",en,2015-10-26,RoyChanYC,Singapore,260,42
2,Cheerful Tiny Museum,"This place located just opposite Sultan Mosque. So if you come to Arab street and you are interested in old toys and other nostalgic things, you can visit this small museum. The entrance ticket price was a small fee (can not remember exactly how much, between SGD3-4 I guess). Many dioramas, toys and stuff from the past (asian life) you can see there.",en,2015-10-19,ericAKIRA,samarinda,231,128
2,In the area,"We were walking in the area and popped in. Nothing we had not seen before, lots of cute toys and ohhh and arrrrs about items one grew up with. The person running the place on the day was more concerned about people taking photos alongside the memorabilia, perhaps they need a sign up.",en,2015-09-02,HellyDP,"Western Australia, Australia",80,23
2,Thirty minute window into the past,"This very small museum seems out of place in the must visit Kapong Glam part of the city. It is a just drop by and check it out kind of place and will take about 30mins to view   There are two floors. It is free to enter on the ground, look around, buy. It has a large robot at the door, a motorbike with passenger car inside with and lots of other old toys and objects from the past. Go upstairs and the owner collects two dollars entrance fee. You will find a wide variety of items ranging from toys, books, posters, school records, and games.",en,2015-08-16,spud2911,"Singapore, Singapore",193,44
3,Nostalgia ,Nice young guy running the place. Nostalgia plus! Worth a pop in. Loved everything  Small but worth a visit if you are in the Arab quarter.,en,2015-08-08,claybraes,"Darwin, Australia",59,9
3,A child again!!,"So happy to see toys I had again, still treasure some of them. Great photo studio at the back of the museum. I am not photogenic but the friendly owner insisted i pose and shoot pictures with my phone for me free of charge. Sent him a postcard after the trip :)",en,2015-05-31,Joanna_vigate,"Hong Kong, China",289,129
3,Looks interesting,We made an attempt to get in here on a Sunday morning but were unfortunately thwarted by some filming that was taking place on the premises. So all we got to see was the tin man near the entrance. Will have to come back again at some stage in the future.,en,2014-12-29,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383
3,Blast to the past!,"Probably the owner is a garung guni (i.e. junk) man, otherwise how does one explain the wide variety of items (ranging from food, drinks, toys, furniture to stationery) found? Some retro toys are available for sale too. One probably need to be 30 years and above to appreciate the items on display.",en,2014-11-18,SingaporeGuest,"Singapore, Singapore",105,27
3,"Quite small, but packed with things","A wonderful overview of decades past, with plenty of toys and stuff kids might have played with or looked at longingly. It's very close to the mosque, and is on the second floor - look for the long black sign to help find the right building.",en,2014-11-10,WorthyGo,"Bangkok, Thailand",182,186
4,Glimpse into the 60s and 70s,"The museum offers an interesting glimpse into the 1960s and 1970s with many personal collections from the owner. It brings back a great sense of nostalgia, especially for Singaporeans who will find many familiar toys like kuti-kuti and marbles. And it only cost $2 per entry. The owner is welcoming and approachable so do chat him up. He was a professional photographer before retiring 10 years ago (so you see a fair bit of vintage camera equipment on display). He has amassed a large collection that has also been neatly organised into sections for viewing.",en,2014-11-01,cwmcwm,Singapore,38,16
4,Cozy little shop filled with childhood,"Admission fee is $2, which is collected by the shop owner. The ground level mainly consists the front shop area which sells old school toys and knit knacks (reasonably priced so do support). The backyard and upper level is the museum area which requires payment to enter. Do pay before entering the museum area as the shop owner can be slightly pushy if you just budge in without paying.   Note: The admission fee sign is not available so new comers might be unaware of the need to pay before entering.  However the museum area is worthwhile especially since it's only $2. A Macdonalds meal costs about SGD 5 so go do your math.   The museum is like what the others have said previously; a transport back to the olden days with the whole place looking like a shophouse that creeks when you climb the stairs. Air condition is provided so you would not sweat inside, thank you.  The amount of stuff collected is massive and all sorted out nicely into categories in the display cases like books, toys, musical instruments etc. There are also big display items like a drink stall, toy stall booths and scooter for people to post and take photos with.  So go and have a fun childhood time by entering this little magical place. Or at least seek shelter for rain/ warm weather in this cozy (and air conditioned) shop house.",en,2014-06-22,hdtee07,"Singapore, Singapore",37,7
4,Bad Experience,"Went there with my wife and 2 friends. Just because i was using a big camera, they claimed i was there on a professional wedding shoot. My friends are students! They're too young to get married. A rude person there simply chased us away and demanded we leave. he even continued to stare us down outside the museum. What a waste of the entrance fee..We didn't even get to see anything. He didn't even bother to listen to our explanation that we weren't there for a wedding shoot. And to think, i only went there because my wife visited before and wanted me to see it for myself..guess i will never be able to now..",en,2013-06-02,SpinworkxRoy,"Singapore, Singapore",2,9
4,Great way to break up walking the streets of little India,"My husband and I stumbled across this little 'museum' when leaving little India for the Arab strip, and what a delight. Although it is just a small house that has been turned into a museum displaying old children's toys and other retro delights, it was highlight of our afternoon. What made it special was the lovely old man (curator?? Not sure) who took it on himself to take us around every mocked up section of the store to get our own theme photos - we cannot stop laughing every time we look back at the pics. Even though it will all be over in 5 minutes, it is Definitely worth a visit!!",en,2013-05-05,Melina_Gee,,8,2
4,Worth a visit !,My seven year old daughter was very interested in looking at all the different toys from yesteryear ...the owner is very friendly and happy for you to take photos. Bussorah st is a great street in Singapore to wander around !,en,2013-05-03,MissFreo,"Perth, Australia",1200,48
5,So cute!,"It's small but it's full of great toys. As I understand it, these are the toys that the owner played with as a child (and through his childhood). This is what makes the place so engaging. And it's only a couple of bucks. Better than the other Toy Museum we went to.  Downstairs it's a shop selling all sorts of funky stuff, from jewellery to vintage furniture and odds and sods, as well as toys. Great for a browse & an original gift.  Very nice indeed & we've been back more than once.  Some nice vintage Vespas out the back.",en,2012-10-30,TelboyofPeckham,"London, United Kingdom",99,43
5,Cute little toy museum,"While we were waiting for opening hour of Musjid Sultan, we visited this little museum. Museum was on second floor (small admission fee). It looked like owner's collection, and although it was very small space, we enjoyed fine. We could see old toys, books, posters, etc. I even saw what looked like owner's grade report. Very personal view of Singapore's early 20 century.   We stayed there around 30 min, and had a really good time. Don't expect whole museum experience, but certainly a nice stop after/before Musjid Sultan.",en,2012-03-13,satoshinfk,"Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan",33,16
