1,candy like colors,"I am not certain about the inside but the facade is stunning. I saw it through the trees passing by, its colors brilliant, like candy peering through trees.   I did not enter because it is an active temple. My rating is based purely off of the building's appearance.",en,2017-10-28,EurAznSF,"Chicago, Illinois",110,34
2,Really Colouful And Ornate,"This is an amazing temple, which is well worth the visit. Wonderful statues, we were there during Deepvali, so it was very busy.",en,2017-10-23,SagaloutsTour,"Gerrards Cross, United Kingdom",1098,376
2,Good,These multi colored temples projecting numerous Hindu deities are built in Dravidian Style. They fascinate both the believers and the non believers. It's inquisitiveness and fascination for the non believers to learn about a different religion. For the believers its the joy of knowing that they were built in the mid 19th century by the first Hindus who crossed the high seas to seek their future in a different land.,en,2017-09-07,avisingh24,"Sydney, Australia",42,5
2,One of Singapore's colourful Hindu Temples.,"The Sri Thendayuthapani Temple, better known as the Chettiars' Temple or the Tank Road temple, is one of the Singapore Hindu community's most important monuments. A Hindu Temple dating from 1859, that started out with humble beginnings as a statue under a bodhi tree, was replaced in 1983. The temple is dedicated to the six-faced Lord Subramaniam and was gazetted as a Singapore national monument on 21 October 2014. Hindu temples are always colourful and interesting places where there is always something to see, and this temple is no exception.",en,2017-03-29,Roberts69,"Northampton, United Kingdom",13282,1241
2,Lovely temple,"It's a bit out of the way but if you're close to the Singapore National Museum or Fort Canning, you can walk. Built in 1859, the colorful temple is one of the most important for local Hindus.",en,2017-03-26,franksV6538FD,"Tokyo, Japan",305,29
2,One of my favourite temple,"One of my favourite temple in Singapore, placed in a quiet location. Beautiful architecture and peaceful place.",en,2017-03-13,ClaudiaDesjardins,"Bucharest, Romania",11,5
3,Nice place to visit and it is allowed to take photos,"Gazetted as a national monument in 2014, the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple (aka Chettiar Temple since it was built by the Chettiar community in 1859) stands on 15 Tank Road. It is dedicated to the Hindu god, Lord Murugan. During the festival of Thaipusam, it is the end site of the procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road. It has received consecrations in 1983, 1996 and 2009. It has a large wedding hall. The pyramid shaped gopuram is a rather appealing feature, seen well from the Tank Road side. Located not too far from the Hong San See, this temple is also a somewhat surprising feature to be seen in the River Valley area.",en,2016-09-14,AyushBasu,"Singapore, Singapore",186,49
3,Fascinating place,"We've just moved to Singapore recently and during the first couple of weeks after we arrived, we passed this temple often. The sight of it was so striking that I wanted to learn more about it, so I was thrilled when the National Heritage Board offered guided tours for a minimal fee (S$5/per adult) this month. We had a volunteer guide tell us all about the history and architecture of the temple as well as the annual Hindu festival Thaipusam which takes place here. This year's event will take place on Sunday, January 24.",en,2016-01-09,Pugmama-san,"Spring, Texas",508,76
3,Small temple,This is a small temple close to the river on Tank Road. The outside is more impressive than the inside. The tower looks pretty and so does the gate. You need to take your shoes off if you want to go inside. If you want to pray you need to buy a ticket but if you just want to look around it is free.,en,2015-10-01,JanaZC,"Prague, Czech Republic",3638,545
3,Pretty little temple,I've walked past this place many times over the years but have only been inside very recently. Non-Hindus can only access a small section of the interior but it's enough to get the general idea. The entrance is quite impressive and reminiscent of some of the temples in Southern India.,en,2014-12-24,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383
3,Beautiful Insight into Indian Temple,"The beautifully ornate Sri Thendayuthapani Temple helped give me insight to another religion's practices. Visitors should remove shoes before entering. The worshipers ring one of the many bells on the door as they pass. Inside are beautiful statues of deities, lotus carvings as base for the overhead lights, and lotus inlays on the floor. As a tourist, you are not allowed past a certain point where worshipers observe their faith, but I observed the activities from the back, including singing, quiet prayer, and an offering of fire. Besides observing, I took photos, so I made a donation in the box marked for doing so. Overall, a very peaceful, pleasant, and insightful visit.",en,2014-05-06,novacamp,"Houston, Texas",950,88
4,Nice place!! ,"Peaceful temple located in the tank road! It is walkable from the dhobi ghat station on the north east line.   Though the environment is good and the Temple decor and deities look blissful - the presence of a wedding hall in the premises of the temple takes away the charm of a place of worship, perhaps they can demarcate it in some way.  Overall worth a visit",en,2014-04-05,foodntraveldiaries,"Bengaluru, India",2003,207
4,A pleasant visit.,"First visited this temple before its renovation in 1983. It's still a good place to visit. Though not so ancient as many temples in India, Sri Lanka, etc., it still offers a similar ambiance.",en,2014-01-15,EarthlingOnline,Worldwide,3816,729
