4,Tasty Dinner,Was shopping at Parkway Parade Mall this evening. Decided to visit the neighbouring hawker centre (2 minutes walk) for dinner. Always crowded and needed to await for available table.  Always love to dine here. Love the rojak (mixed fruits salad in prawn paste and peanut) and mee siam. Both selling at the same stall by 2 chinese men.  $3 for rojak and $3 for mee siam. Not much portion of food but very tasty. Thats why whenever I craving for mee siam will definitely come here.  Enjoyed. Will come again.,en,2017-03-04,linweisingapore,"Singapore, Singapore",4852,183

Mostly locals...didn't see any tourists while I was there.  The food is very tasty. I enjoyed it tremendously. Not pricey and serves a good portion.  The coffee shop a couple of stalls over has great coffee!  The nasi lemak at this stall should not be missed if you're in the neighbourhood. The proprietor/s is/are very friendly.
