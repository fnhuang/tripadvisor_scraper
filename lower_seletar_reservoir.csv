1,Ideal for outdoor exercise ,"Cool place to exercise because it was a long stretch of walkway with nature tripping on the side while walking, biking or jogging overlooking the clean and well protected reservoir. Fishing site also and playground for toodlers.  Nice place to relieve stress .",en,2019-09-20,Realtalk_kirsten,"Singapore, Singapore",23,1
1,Off the beaten track,"Lower Seletar Reservoir is located in north-eastern Singapore (closest MRT red line, Khatib). In the very early morning, it is a sanctuary from the urban high-rise environment that is Singapore, although the towering HDB blocks of Yishun still remind you that you are in a city. As the sky slowly lightens at dawn, the calm tranquillity of the waters reflect back the pastel hues of the rising sun. The heritage bridge allows some reflecting views of the reservoir waters, while a short walk along the western shores brings you to the fishing deck, for more views. There are fairly large trees shading this walk, which makes it pleasant in the morning, but I suspect it would get much hotter later. The more adventurous can press on down Lentor Avenue and westwards across to Springleaf Park, which is a pleasant 40 min stroll (but avoid when the sun is out, as there isn't much shade).",en,2019-07-20,mostlyharmless,"Singapore, Singapore",1083,277
1,A little nature,"It's a nice and peaceful place, you can get into the sun and get some nice tan. Look out for the people canoe and fishing and hunting",en,2019-04-04,XavierShoot,"Singapore, Singapore",740,341
1,Tranquil and Serene,"Our grassroots committee organized a brisk walk at this reservoir park for residents followed by a round table lunch at Joy Garden Restaurant at Jurong Safra Club after the brisk walk. I was tasked to be the bus in-charge. Frankly speaking, as a local born Singaporean, I felt `ashamed' to tell the residents that this was my first time visiting this reservoir park.   A total of 370 residents participated in the brisk walk and I felt the tranquility and serenity of this place is adversely affected by the momentous noise from the huge crowd.   We alighted from our buses and walked from one end to the other end.of the reservoir. The distance is estimated to be about 1.5 km and most of our brisk walkers complained that it was too short to be really physically beneficial. Most of the walkers efficiently covered the distance within 15 mins.   At the end of the walk, we came to a heritage bridge that extended to the center of the reservoir. I also mingled with the crowd to read the information panels on the historical development of this Seletar Reservoir. It apparently was built in 1986 and was initially named Sungei Seletar Reservoir. The areas surrounding the reservoir were initially pineapple and gambier plantations before the area gave way to other development and Seletar River was traditionally a part of the river transportation network to the city. It is intriguing to learn so much information on this reservoir from that few information panels at the heritage bridge.   The architectural design of this heritage bridge resembled a kelong with stilts extending seaward. There is also a water play area before the heritage bridge. Children will find this water play area and the water fountain interesting.   The water in the reservoir appears calm and tranquil. There is also another boardwalk which extended to the middle of the reservoir and few anglers were patiently fishing with their line dipped below the water surface. I understand that the rewards for the anglers are tilapias and snakeheads.   We spent about an hour here before boarding the bus to Jurong Safra.   If you ask me if this reservoir park is suitable for group brisk walking, I would say yes. Because of her `remote' location, many Singaporeans would just find it troublesome or inconvenient to visit the park unless you are staying nearby or some organizing committee deliberately bring you here.    There are also watersports activities like kayaking and canoeing but it is not free.   Glad to discover another reservoir park. Hope to re-visit it another day.",en,2019-01-20,soh_kien_peng,"Singapore, Singapore",6155,2988
1,Suburban day trip mixing Nature and Local culture ,"Off the beaten path for most tourists, even compared with other national parks connectors, the Lower Seletar Reservoir is a popular jogging site and fishing as well the photography park partially because itâ€™s near Yishun town and partially near a country club and forest areas. After exercise, one can shop for fresh seafood in one of the wet markets at AMK hub 620, and eat local food at place like Seng Kee bak kut teh or CHONG Pang estate in Yishun. The mixture of nature and local culture is worth half a day or more. We spent a whole day there today.",en,2018-12-28,nmiyuh,"Singapore, Singapore",468,32
2,Relaxing walk by the lake,"Pretty neat park, not far from our home in Woodlands. We visit the park sometimes in the morning or after dark to enjoy nice breeze and walk by the lake. The park has a lot limited parking lots so be prepare to park at the HDB car park on other side of the Yushun ave 1 if the parking lots are full. You may also use several bus services to the park. Once in the park, there are several walkways to enjoy the nature. Views at early morning and at sunset are breathtakingly beautiful",en,2018-08-12,824deveshd,"Singapore, Singapore",1093,39

2,Good Place for Sunrise in Singapore,This is a pretty good place to catch Sunrise even if it is not on a entirely clear day. It was very quiet and quaint and not many people here on a Saturday morning accept a handful taking photographs and some people exercising.

A well-laid out park with plenty of activities tailored for young and old... water sports, kayaking, dragon boating, a family bay, water play area for children, lots of benches to sit and admire unobstructed views of the reservoir. The main attractions would be the Heritage bridge and the long curved kelong-like boardwalk extending into middle of reservoir with look-out platforms allowing visitors opportunity to spot fishes and other insects like damselflies and dragonflies. It's a place for photo enthusiasts to capture beautiful sunset of the reservoir and nice view of the golf course.

4,Good for morning and evening walks and jogs,"This reservoir looks more like a sea than a reservoir. It is actually a part of the sea which has been dammed up. It is linked to Upper Seletar by a canal. Good for morning and evening walks or jogs. If you are into fishing or kayaking, they are available here. Benches are provided here for family to sit around and picnicking.  This reservoir is easily accessible by public transport.

I highly recommend visiting this place if you are looking for a quick getaway or just to be away from all the noise.",en,2015-01-07,gsahgal,Singapore,54,32
5,Small reservoir,This is a small reservoir to the north of Singapore with a pretty little park. There is an attractive pontoon going out into the reservoir and some information displays on the history of Singapore's reservoirs. I found the Upper Seletar reservoir to be more impressive.,en,2014-12-22,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383
5,A nice place to cool down in the evening,"This place is nice and cooling to stroll around in the evening. Though it is a reservoir, it is also a fishing area (with no live bait), a jogger's area and a family picnic area in the evening. Moreover, kayaking is also allowed within the permitted perimeter.",en,2014-11-18,new88,singapore,774,339
5,Pretty Reservoir Park with Good Fishing,"This little reservoir park is pretty far out in the north of Singapore, so I wouldn't make a trip specially to it unless I happened to be in Yishun or one of the surrounding neighbourhoods. In fact, although it is a very pleasant park it's really more of a neighbourhood park. There is a 1.3km long jogging track, and a stage area which includes a water play area.  Other attractions are the water sports - canoeing/kayaking and dragon-boating, as well as the supposedly good fishing. If you are a keen angler then you might well want to visit the reservoir park.
