1,Encounter with the Monitor Lizard,"It‚Äôs Sunday, so we decided to go and sweat it out. After careful consideration and brainstorming, we finally decided with Lower Pierce and made our way here. As we reached the weather was good but soon the sun was up and shining it‚Äôs light everywhere. But no worries, we came prepared with some layers of sunblock.   The place is lovely and vast, and has three trails to follow (the trails are not that long not to worry). So we started out and went about clicking numerous pictures on the way. We also met a number of monkey friends, the best way to avoid them is to just leave them alone and not to react, they will leave you alone too. As we went deeper, I was wondering when we will stumble upon a monitor lizard and luckily we did. The moment it saw us, it started moving away but I got my shot üòç. After strolling for about 1.5 hours we were done, and made our way back. Fruitful days as such keep me going.",en,2019-09-22,iammanishg,"Singapore, Singapore",420,6
1,Great location for a walk in the evening,"Not too crowded, nice place for a walk in the evening to get away from the busy city life.

2,Appreciate the nature and slow your pace,"I managed to book an eco-trail walk at Lower Peirce Reservoir Park for a bus load of my residents. The 49 of us came in a bus and alighted at Casuarina Entrance and the two volunteer guides from our National Park were already waiting for us at the entrance. .    This reservoir was totally new to us as we had not ventured that far from the West to this part of Singapore. From the starting point at Casuarina Entrance, the guides led us through the dense jungle walking on the wooden boardwalk along Hevea Trail to Cyathea Trail and then to the Bamboo Trail before proceed on the Oncospermum Trail next to the water catchment area. Our bus was waiting for us at the end point of the trail.   The guide pointed to us the rubber tree, the nibong palm tree, the ferns, the chempedak tree and explained their characteristics to us. Rubber trees came from Brazil. The wood of the nibong trees was resistant to water corrosion and that made the wood suitable for house construction near the coastal areas. There was also the `chee cheong fun' leaves that were used to wrap chee cheong fun (a kind of rice cake} just like banana leaves were used to wrap for nasi lemak. Those days there were no Styrofoam boxes or plastic bag and leaves were used to wrap food.   We saw a tree with fig fruits and the guide explained that the figs were a form of food for the animals living in the jungle. Ferns grow along with the trees and some of the trees were extremely tall stretching their branches towards the sky.   It was a lovely day of outing. The air is fresh and the surrounding tranquil and serene. The catchment area is also rather scenic. We saw a few of the visitors were near the water coast practicing qigong or meditation.   The trail walk took about an hour and thirty minutes. It was enriching and refreshing exploring this eco trail. I think more people should visit this catchment area and explore the eco trail .   It is free admission. Immerse yourself in nature and marvel at our biodiversity.",en,2019-06-29,soh_kien_peng,"Singapore, Singapore",6155,2988
2,Beautiful Park,"Dont just walk around the main park area, one should venture off to the trails.  The first turns around the trail, it is such a beautiful place with the boardwalk next to the water.  Come with your camera, be as one with nature.",en,2019-03-23,plwh888,"Singapore, Singapore",2112,2565

The view of reservoir along the trail was beautiful and serene.   Good for short exercise and taking a break from the busy city.,en,2018-11-18,GladysK908,"Singapore, Singapore",272,15
3,wonderful place to be,"We were fortunate to be staying within walking distance of the Trail that winds through the water reserve. The trail itself consists of a wooden platform in pristine condition with the steps well marked in bright yellow. It winds through jungle and along the catchment basin. While walking, or running for that matter, you have a good chance of spotting a wide range of birds and water fowl, mouse deer, sometimes aggressive wild boars (be careful they can be dangerous with their razor sharp tusks), bothersome monkeys keelny aware of anyone carrying a snack. and other wildlife. All and all a great way to combine exercise, fresh air and experience a jungle environment.",en,2018-10-26,roamer70,Don Lorenzo,308,136
3,Peaceful reservoir away from the crowds,"Lower Peirce Reservoir seems to be a lot less crowded than on might expect, given that it's relatively accessible. Took the kids there today for an outing and they had a good time. The playground is pretty small though.",en,2018-02-03,KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",38091,2383

3,Usually a quiet tranquil park,"This small park provides an enjoyable forest walk around the edge of the reservoir. You may spot monkeys, wild boar, monitor lizards and perhaps other smaller creatures if you are lucky. A couple of picnic tables, good ablutions and a small play area for children. Nice for short sunset walks.",en,2017-12-13,398claytonc,"Springs, South Africa",59,32
3,"Easily accessible, very pretty views and delightful boardwalk","This is one of the prettiest reservoir as one can see the golf course at the far end. Its view reminded me of Lake Buttermere in Lake district without the mountains. The water is very still in the morning and one can see the symmetrical reflection of the bridge and trees. It is quite a small place and this place can be easily covered in less than an hour including the lovely boardwalk with well placed information boards. There are some people here exercising, meditating or taking a stroll. There are many buses such as 167, 163, 980, 855 passing along the main road outside the reservoir",en,2017-11-19,Kim025Singapore,"Singapore, Singapore",7417,774
4,Great for Morning/Evening walks,"A short distance from my home. I love to walk in the evening to have the view of Sunset. Sometimes, there's monkeys hanging around. There also an upgraded toilet which i think is much welcome and better. Although the carpark is rather dim and quiet, it's still quite safe. for ladies, try to go earlier or with someone. Its rather quiet in the late evening.  Remember to bring along- water and insect repellent.",en,2017-05-03,anncP4614YN,"Singapore, Singapore",3,0
4,Walking ,It's very quiet in the afternoon when we visited for a walk. There are some benches so you can also relax and read books if it's in the shape. We love this place. There are wild monkeys around this area.,en,2017-04-14,322kaorim,"Singapore, Singapore",249,22
4,"4.5/5 - Excellent for meditation, morning walks!","Came here for a morning walk in the middle of an extremely busy week, this place is a secret hideout away from the cares of the world!   Scenery: 4.5/5 Cleanliness: 4.5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Physical Ease: 5/5  Fun: 4/5  What we did: Simple reflective walk around the Park.  The Good: Quiet, really quiet and peaceful, can hear the crescendo of nature singing early in the morning, and the quiet calm still waters that's good for the soul.   The Bad: It's a simple place, I love it a lot, just that compared to other more majestic places it may not be much to some people, and also not a lot of things to do, so for balance sake it might be more for some.   Bottom Line: Come here in smaller groups, for quiet reflective mornings / evenings. It's great for just simple chillax! People who love crowds may not enjoy it as much here :)",en,2016-12-06,S102OOdaniell,"Singapore, Singapore",1345,60
4,Great for walks,"The trails are well laid out and one on them is a narrow walkway between the thick forest on one side and the reservoir edge on the other. There are plenty of naughty monkeys to observe and take photos. If you are lucky, you may also encounter monitor lizards and various types of birds. As it was day time, we did see any wild boars known to frequent the area.",en,2016-11-13,kapitanchina,"Singapore, Singapore",1159,171
4,A nice Quiet place,This place is really amazing. I stay just opposite the Lower Pierce Reservior. The trail walk is good. The sunset view is spectacular. When i googled about this place I read that we can see wild boars. I thought it was not true. But recently i seen boars. Alot of monkeys can be seen too. People around greet each other too. Married couples have a photoshoot in thier wedding attire. A place must visit.,en,2016-07-23,ferrareia2016,"Singapore, Singapore",41,4
5,Beautiful Place n Free for All,"This should be spelt as Lower Pierce Reservoir. It is located along upper Thomson Road. There's a car park if one is driving. There is no entrance fee. Its free for all to enjoy even pet dogs. Good for dating, family outing or with friends. Sunset here is simply amazing.",en,2016-06-03,JustLoveToFly,"Singapore, Singapore",7636,381
5,Quiet park with great view,"Quiet park within walking distance from Bishan Park I. Fresh air, lots of greenery, short boardwalks available, fishing allowed at certain parts of the reservoir. Nice sunset.",en,2016-04-25,kwoong,Singapore,1013,202
5,Great Walk,"It was easy to find by car. There is parking available. Please remember to take parking coupons. It's 50 cent per half an hour.  The day I went it had been raining in the morning, which meant it was nice and cool.   There is boardwalk through the jungle and along the reservoir.  There is information signs on the types of flowers, animals etc. Please be aware you may come across snakes. I didn't.   Overall it was a lovely place to visit.",en,2016-04-16,Lawriesj,"Forfar, United Kingdom",573,171
5,A small walking trail set amongst the lower Peirce reservoir,"The Peirce reservoir occupies the central core of Singapore, and from Google Maps it looks like a vast (relatively speaking!) body of water that should be surrounded by verdant greenery. The access to Lower Peirce Reservoir park is off the Old Upper Thomson road, and starts promisingly from the car park with a panoramic view of the still body of water, reflected in the early morning light. Turning right, you start off skirting the edge of water and onto a boardwalk, which meanders along the waters edge before turning inwards into the secondary forest. Within the forest, all is calm and peaceful with plots of trees and palms. All too soon, however, the trail ends back out into Old Upper Thomson Road (approximately 20 mins of brisk walking), and you have to make your way back to the car park. Beyond the unreachable distant shores of the reservoir, the greenery beckons, tantalizingly close but frustratingly out of reach. Some monkeys roam the shores, looking for handouts, but avoid feeding them. Good for a brief wander and soul-refresh if you are in the region.",en,2015-10-31,mostlyharmless,"Singapore, Singapore",1083,277
